<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><i>The Patriot (Piccolo Mondo Antico)</i> was
published in Milan in 1896, and has reached
its forty-fourth edition, which is in itself sufficient
proof of its popularity; for Italians do not purchase
books largely, and one volume will often
make the tour of a town, coming out of the campaign
in rags and a newspaper cover.</p>

<p>Although <i>The Patriot</i> is not an historical novel
in the true sense of the term, it certainly throws a
wonderful side-light on those ten years of "deadly
cold and awful silence," a silence broken only from
time to time by the cries of the martyrs of Mantua,
by the noise of inward strife in the Papal States,
and by the weeping of mothers who saw their sons
disappear behind the clanging doors of Austrian
fortresses. These ten years stretched drearily
from the disastrous field of Novara to the glorious
days of Magenta, Solferino and San Martino
(1849&ndash;59).</p>

<p>Antonio Fogazzaro, born in Vicenza in 1842,
was a child when the battle of Novara was fought
and lost; but when the French drove the Austrians
from the bloody field of Magenta, he, a
youth of seventeen, was ready to be fired with
patriotic enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
    During those years, there was little the patriots
could do save to feed the fire of hatred against
the foreign oppressors, and prepare, as best they
could, in secret and in constant danger of death,
for the moment when Piedmont should once more
give the signal of revolt.</p>

<p>In the night that succeeded the battle of Novara,
King Carlo Alberto, who had risked all for the
freedom of the rest of Italy&mdash;for it must be remembered
that his own kingdom of Sardinia was
independent of Austria&mdash;discouraged, mortified,
and impoverished, abdicated in favour of his son,
Victor Emmanuel. It was no longer possible to
continue hostilities, and Carlo Alberto hoped that
his son, whose wife, Maria Adelaide, was the
daughter of an Austrian grand-duke, might obtain
more favourable conditions from Austria for
his unhappy country. On the following day the
young King and Field-Marshal Radetzky met, and
a peace was signed, the conditions of which Victor
Emmanuel found great difficulty in persuading his
parliament to ratify. But in the end Piedmont
paid Austria an indemnity of seventy-five million
francs.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel had not, however, abandoned
the idea of United Italy, and could say with
Massimo D'Azeglio: We will begin over again,
and do better! Count Camillo Benso di Cavour,
one of the greatest statesmen of modern times,
stood by the King from the first. They immediately
turned their attention towards bettering
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
the condition of their impoverished country, and
soon succeeded in rendering the little capital,
Turin, one of the brightest and most prosperous
cities of the Continent. The patriots, the best
men in Italy, flocked to Turin from all those
states where Austria or her tools held sway.
The Piedmontese government granted subsidies to
some of these refugees, and found employment for
others, receiving all with open arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mazzini and Garibaldi were working,
sometimes at home, sometimes in exile, while in
Mantua brave patriots, among them several
saintly priests, were suffering torture and death at
the hands of the Austrians. The records of their
trials revealed such palpable and flagrant violation
of all justice, all law, that when the Austrians
were at last expelled from Mantua, they were careful
to remove these to Vienna, where they are still
preserved. The aged mother of one of the priests
who suffered execution appealed to the young Empress
Elisabeth, begging that her son's body might
be restored to her, and receive burial in consecrated
ground. But Elisabeth was deaf to the unhappy
woman's prayers. During the long and desolate
years of her own affliction, how often must the
unfortunate Empress have thought of the tears of
blood the mothers of Italy had shed! It was
Field-Marshal Haynau of inglorious memory, he
who for his cruelties in that city had been dubbed
the "hyena of Brescia," who tortured these martyrs
of Mantua and signed their death-warrants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
    All these things were happening during those
ten years of heavy silence when Fogazzaro was a
child. We can fancy how eagerly he listened to
the accounts of these horrors, and to the long and
animated discussions his father (Franco Maironi
of <i>The Patriot</i>) and his uncle (Uncle Piero) held
with the brilliant company that assembled at
Casa Fogazzaro. His father took an active part
in the defence of Vicenza in 1848, while his mother,
whom he has portrayed for us in the lovely
character of Signora Luisa Rigey, busied herself
with scraping lint and making cockades for the
soldiers. These events and scenes, which so
deeply impressed the child, were ever present to
the mind of the man, and the long cherished project
of immortalising those personages and places
which were both familiar and dear to him, was at
last realised in the pages of <i>The Patriot</i>, in
which, evoking personal memories of the past,
he gives us a stirring account of the petty persecutions
and base meanness to which the mighty
Austria stooped during that period of suspense
and anxiety. The intrigues of the rogue Pasotti,
the skirmishes of the wicked old Marchesa with
the adjutant of the great Radetzky himself, fill
us with indignation and contempt, while we thrill
with patriotic emotion when Luisa raises her glass
and whispers: "Hurrah for Cavour!"&mdash;<i>whispers</i>
the words, because in those days the very walls
had ears, and in her toast there breathed sedition!</p>

<p>As the years passed and peace and prosperity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
settled over United Italy, another question,
that of the religious life, began to occupy the
master-mind of Antonio Fogazzaro. Intensely
but broadly religious himself, he could not fail to
introduce into his work the burning question of
belief or unbelief which, from long contemplation
and study, had become, as it were, a part
of himself. The artistic motive of the book,
the struggle between an unbelieving wife and an
intensely religious husband, came to the Italian
reader as a new revelation. Had Fogazzaro
been influenced by certain works which had already
excited much comment and discussion in
England and America? Perhaps so; but at all
events he has treated the subject differently, and
in his own masterly fashion; he has spared us the
long and tedious tirades of personages who are,
after all, simply mouthpieces, and has given us
instead two warm and palpitating human beings,
who live and act in accordance with their opinions,
and whose innermost souls are laid bare to us by
their own deeds, their own actions. Franco and
Luisa do not discuss and argue, they simply <i>feel</i>,
feel intensely, and by a few burning words here,
a few delicate touches there, our author leads us
to feel with them, to understand and sympathise
with their impulses, their passions, and their
weaknesses.</p>

<p>We may not agree with Fogazzaro's conclusions,
but we cannot but admire the masterly delineation
of character, the unstudied and thoroughly artistic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
arrangement of the work, and the skilful handling
of so many different elements.</p>

<p>The very simplicity and directness of his
language give to his style a grandeur all its own,
and lend a peculiar charm to his descriptions
of nature, which form some of the most fascinating
pages of <i>The Patriot</i>. With a few broad
strokes, he spreads before us a landscape of
ineffable beauty, or shows us the fury of the
maddened elements. How marvellous in its
solemn grandeur is the picture of the struggle
between the sun and the fog, which Uncle Piero
witnesses from the terrace at Oria! How wonderful
in its awe-inspiring realism is the story of
Franco's journey across the mountains, in the
darkness of a moonless night! And that glorious
picture of the sunrise, when Franco's crushed and
tortured soul soars upwards again with the growing
light, and, inspired and comforted, he once
more squares his shoulders, and takes up his
heavy burden of care!</p>

<p>Infinite sweetness breathes from the pages which
deal with the short and sunny life of dear little
Maria, and there are passages full of humour
and whimsical reflections that must remind the
English reader of Dickens.</p>

<p>Perhaps when Fogazzaro wrote <i>The Patriot</i>, he
had already planned the trilogy of which it
forms the first volume, but certainly the trilogy
was rather evolved than planned, evolved from
the union of two such characters as Franco and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Luisa; and probably, while writing the first, the
author was, to a certain extent, ignorant of what
the second and third volumes would contain;
for Luisa and Franco, Jeanne and Piero are not
puppets which have been fitted into a story, but
the story is in every particular the outcome of
their personalities.</p>

<p>Certain it is that when we read the promise contained
in the closing lines of <i>The Patriot</i>, we look
forward eagerly to the succeeding volumes of the
trilogy; and when, after that marvellous scene in
the gardener's house, we reluctantly bid farewell
to the Saint, our first thought is a hope that the
master may soon resume his magic pen and continue
the struggle for the purification and regeneration
of the Faith, and, through the Faith,
of Mankind.</p>

heavily about the dark mountain-tops. Indeed,
when the Pasottis reached Casarico on their way
down from Albogasio Superiore, it had not yet
begun to rain. The waves beat and thundered
on the shore, jostling the boats at their moorings,
while flashing tongues of white foam showed, here
and there, as far as the frowning banks of the
Doi over yonder. But down in the west, at the
end of the lake, a line of light could be seen, a
sign of approaching calm, of the diminishing
<i>breva</i>, and behind the gloomy Caprino hill appeared
the first misty rain. Pasotti, in his full
dress black overcoat, a tall hat on his head, his
hand grasping a thick bamboo walking-stick,
was pacing nervously along the shore, peering
now in this direction, now in that, or stopping
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
to beat his stick upon the ground, and to shout
for that ass of a boatman, who had not yet
appeared.</p>

<p>The little black boat, with its red cushions,
its red and white awning, its movable seat, used
only on special occasions, fixed crosswise in its
place, the oars lying ready amidship, was struggling,
buffeted by the waves, between two coal
barges, which hardly moved.</p>

<p>"Pin!" shouted Pasotti, growing more and
more angry. "Pin!"</p>

<p>The only answer was the regular, constant
thundering of the waves on the shore, and the
bumping of one boat against another. At that
moment one would have said there was not so
much as a live dog in the whole of Casarico.
Only a plaintive, old voice, like the husky falsetto
of a ventriloquist, groaned from beneath the
portico&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better walk?"</p>

<p>At last Pin appeared in the direction of San
Mamette.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, there!" shrieked Pasotti, raising
his arms. The man began to run.</p>

<p>"Beast!" Pasotti roared. "It was with good
reason they gave you the name of a dog!"</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better walk, Pasotti?" groaned
the plaintive voice. "Let us walk!"</p>

<p>Pasotti continued to abuse the boatman, who
was hastily unfastening the chain of his boat
from a ring, fixed in the bank. Presently he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
turned towards the portico, with an authoritative
air, and jerking his chin, motioned to some one
to come forward.</p>

<p>"Let us walk, Pasotti!" the voice groaned
<a name="one" id="one"></a>once more.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, made a rough gesture
of command with his hand, and started
down towards the boat.</p>

<p>Then an old lady appeared under one of the
arches of the portico, her lean person enveloped
in an Indian shawl, below which a black silk
skirt showed. Her head was surmounted by a
fashionable bonnet, spindling, and lofty, trimmed
with tiny yellow roses, and black lace. Two
black curls framed the wrinkled face; the eyes
were large and gentle, and the wide mouth was
shaded by a faint moustache.</p>

<p>"Oh Pin!" she exclaimed, clasping her canary-coloured
gloves, and pausing on the bank to gaze
helplessly at the boatman. "Can we really venture
out with the lake in this state?"</p>

<p>Her husband made a still more imperious
gesture, and his face assumed a still sourer expression.
The poor woman slipped down to the boat
in silence, and was helped in, trembling violently.</p>

<p>"I commend myself to Our Lady of Caravino,
my good Pin!" she said. "What a dreadful
lake!"</p>

<p>The boatman shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>"By the way!" Pasotti exclaimed, "have
you brought the sail along?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
    "It is up at the house," Pin answered. "Shall
I go for it? But perhaps the Signora here, might
be frightened. Besides, here comes the rain!"</p>

<p>"Go and fetch it," said Pasotti.</p>

<p>The Signora, who was as deaf as a post, had not
heard a word of this conversation, and, greatly
amazed at seeing Pin run off, asked her husband
where he was going.</p>

<p>"The sail!" Pasotti shouted into her face. She
sat, bending forward, her mouth wide open,
striving in vain, to catch, at least, the sound of
his voice.</p>

<p>"The sail!" he repeated, still louder, his hands
framing his mouth.</p>

<p>She began to think that she understood.
Trembling with fright she drew a questioning
hieroglyphic in the air with her finger. Pasotti
answered by drawing an imaginary curve in the
air, and blowing into it; then he silently nodded
his head. His wife, convulsed with terror, started
to leave the boat.</p>

<p>"I am going to get out!" said she in an agonised
voice. "I am going to get out! I want to
walk!"</p>

<p>Her husband seized her by the arm, and pulled
her down into her seat, fixing two flaming eyes
upon her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boatman had returned with the
sail. The poor woman writhed and sighed; tears
stood in her eyes, and she cast despairing glances
at the shore, but she was silent. The mast was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
raised, the two lower ends of the sail were made
fast, and the boat was about to put out, when a
voice bellowed from the portico&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hallo! Hallo! The Signor Controllore!" and
out popped a big, rubicund priest, with a glorious
belly, a large, black straw hat, a cigar in his mouth,
and an umbrella under his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh! Curatone!" Pasotti exclaimed. "Well
done! Are you invited to the dinner also? Are
you coming to Cressogno with us?"</p>

<p>"If you will take me," the curate of Puria
answered, going down towards the boat. "Well,
I never! The Signora Barborin is here also."</p>

<p>The expression of his big face became supremely
amiable, his great voice became supremely
sweet.</p>

<p>"She is devilish frightened, poor creature!"
Pasotti grinned, while the curate was making a
series of little bows, and smiling sweetly upon the
lady, who was more terrified than ever at the prospect
of this added weight. She began to gesticulate
silently, as if the others had been more deaf
than she herself. She pointed to the lake, to the
sail, to the bulk of the enormous curate, raising her
eyes to heaven, hiding her face in her hands, or
pressing them to her heart.</p>

<p>"I don't weigh so very much," said the curate
laughing. "Hold your tongue, will you?" he
added, turning to Pin, who had murmured disrespectfully:
"A good, big fish!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how we can cure her of her fright!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Pasotti exclaimed. "Pin, have you a little table,
and a pack of <i>tarocchi</i><a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> cards?"</p>

<p>"I have a pack," Pin replied. "But they are
rather greasy."</p>

<p>They had great difficulty in making Signora
Barbara&mdash;generally called <i>Barborin</i>&mdash;understand
the matter in hand. She would not understand,
not even when her husband forced the pack of
filthy cards into her hands.</p>

<p>For the present, however, playing was out of
the question. The boat was being laboriously
rowed forward towards the mouth of the river
of San Mamette, where they would be able to
hoist the sail. The surf, flung back from the shore,
clashed with the in-coming waves, and the little
boat was tossing about among the seething,
foaming crests. The lady was weeping and
Pasotti was swearing at Pin, who had not stood
out into the lake far enough. At last the fat
curate seized a couple of oars, and planting his
big person firmly in the middle of the boat, bent
to his work with such good will that a few strokes
sufficed to send them forward and out of difficulty.
Then the sail was hoisted, and the boat glided
quietly and smoothly onward, rocking slowly and
gently, while the water gurgled softly under its
keel. Then the smiling priest sat down beside
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Signora Barborin, who had closed her eyes and
was muttering. But Pasotti drummed impatiently
on the table with the cards, and play
they must.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the grey rain was creeping slowly
towards them, veiling the mountains, and stifling
the <i>breva</i>.</p>

<p>The lady's breath returned in proportion as the
wind's breath diminished, and she played resignedly,
calmly oblivious to her own gross mistakes,
and her husband's consequent outbursts of rage.
When the rain began to rustle on the boat's awning,
on the lifeless waves, which in the now almost
breathless atmosphere, were rolling in against the
rocks of the Tentiòn; when the boatman, judging
it best to lower the sail, took to the oars once
more, then, at last, Signora Barborin breathed
freely. "Pin, my good fellow!" she said tenderly,
and began playing <i>tarocchi</i> with a zeal, an energy
and an expression of beatitude, which neither
mistakes nor scoldings could trouble.</p>

<p>Many days of <i>breva</i> and of rain, of sunshine and
of storm have dawned and faded away over the
Lake of Lugano, over the hills of Valsolda since
that game of cards was played by Signora Pasotti,
her husband, the retired controller of customs,
and the big curate of Puria, in the boat which
coasted slowly along the rocky shore between San
Mamette and Cressogno in the misty rain.</p>

<p>The times were grey and sleepy, in keeping with
the aspect of sky and lake, after the <i>breva</i> had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
subsided, the breeze which had so terrified Signora
Pasotti. The great <i>breva</i><a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> of 1848, after bringing
a few hours of sunshine, and striving awhile with
the heavy clouds, had slumbered for three years,
allowing one breathless, gloomy, silent day to
follow another in those places where the scene of
this humble tale of mine is laid.</p>

<p>The king and queens of <i>tarocchi</i>, the <i>mondo</i>, the
<i>matto</i> and the <i>bagatto</i>, were imported personages
at that time, and in those parts; minor powers
tolerated benevolently by the great, silent Austrian
empire; and their antagonisms, their alliances,
their wars, were the only political questions which
might be freely discussed. Even Pin, as he rowed,
eagerly poked his hooked and inquisitive nose into
Signora Barborin's cards, withdrawing it reluctantly
again. Once he paused in his rowing, and
let his nose hover above the cards, to see how the
poor woman would extricate herself from a difficult
position; what she would do with a certain
card it was dangerous to play, and equally dangerous
to hold. Her husband thumped impatiently
on the little table, the big curate sorted his cards
with a blissful smile, while she clasped hers to her
bosom, now laughing, now groaning, and rolling
her eyes from one to the other of her companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
    "She holds the <i>matto</i>," the curate whispered.</p>

<p>"She always goes on like that when she has the
<i>matto</i>," said Pasotti, and called to her, thumping
the table one more&mdash;</p>

<p>"Out with the <i>matto</i>!"</p>

<p>"I will throw him into the lake!" said she. She
cast a glance towards the prow, and, as an excuse,
remarked that they were nearing Cressogno, and
that it was time to stop playing.</p>

<p>Her husband fumed awhile, but finally resigned
himself to putting on his gloves.</p>

<p>"Trout to-day, curate!" he observed, while
his meek wife buttoned them for him. "White
truffles, grouse, and wine from Ghemme."</p>

<p>"Then you know!" the curate exclaimed. "I
know it also. The cook told me yesterday at
Lugano."</p>

<p>"And besides, some ladies have been invited;
the Carabellis, mother and daughter. Those
Carabellis from Loveno, you know."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" the curate exclaimed. "Is there
any scheme&mdash;&mdash;? There is Don Franco, now,
in his boat. But what a strange flag the young
man is flying! I never saw him with it before."</p>

<p>Pasotti raised the awning and looked out. At
a little distance a boat flying a white and blue
flag rose and fell in unison with the weary motion
of the waves. In the stern, under the flag,
sat Don Franco Maironi, the grandson of
the old Marchesa Orsola, who was giving the
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
    Pasotti saw him rise, grasp the oars, and pull
away, rowing slowly towards the upper lake, towards
the wild gulf of the Doi, the white and blue
flag spread wide, and floating above the boat's
trail.</p>

<p>"Where is that eccentric young man going?"
said he. And he muttered between his teeth; in
the strained and husky voice of a Milanese rough&mdash;"A
surly fellow!"</p>

<p>"They say he has great talents," the priest
observed.</p>

<p>"An empty head," the other declared. "Much
arrogance, little learning, no manners!"</p>

<p>"And half rotten," he added. "If I were that
young woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which?" the curate questioned.</p>

<p>"Why, Signorina Carabelli."</p>

<p>"Mark my words, Signor Controllore! If the
grouse and white truffles are meant for that
Carabelli girl, they are thrown away!"</p>

<p>"Do you know something?" Pasotti inquired,
his eyes flaming with curiosity.</p>

<p>The priest did not answer because, at that point,
the bow grated on the gravel, and touched the
landing-stage. He got out first; Pasotti, with
rapid and imperious gestures, gave his wife some
orders of unknown purport. Then he himself
left the boat. Last to get out was the poor
woman, wrapped in her Indian shawl, bending
under the tall, black bonnet with the little, yellow
roses, staggering, and stretching out her big hands
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in the canary-coloured gloves. The two curls,
hanging on either side of her meek ugliness, gave
her a special air of resignation, under the umbrella
of her husband, proprietor, inspector and jealous
custodian of so much elegance.</p>

<p>The three went up to the portico, by means of
which the little Villa Maironi spans the road
leading from the landing-stage to the parish-church
of Cressogno. Between two happy sighs,
the curate and Pasotti sniffed an indistinct, warm
odour, which floated out from the open vestibule
of the villa.</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>risotto! risotto!</i>" the priest whispered,
with a greedy glow on his face.</p>

<p>Pasotti, who had a keen nose, shook his head,
knitting his brows in manifest contempt for that
other nose.</p>

<p>"It is not <i>risotto</i>," said he.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying it is not <i>risotto</i>?"
the priest exclaimed in vexation. "It <i>is risotto</i>;
<i>risotto</i> with truffles. Don't you smell it?"</p>

<p>Both stopped half way across the vestibule,
sniffing the air noisily like a couple of hounds.</p>

<p>"Do me the favour, my dear curate, to confine
your remarks to <i>posciandra</i>," said Pasotti, after
a long pause, alluding to a certain coarse dish
the peasants prepare, with cabbage and sausages.
"Truffles there are, but <i>risotto</i> there is not!"</p>

<p>"<i>Posciandra! posciandra!</i>" the other grumbled,
somewhat offended. "As to that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The poor, meek lady understood that they were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
quarrelling, and, much alarmed, began pointing
upward towards the ceiling, with her right forefinger,
to warn them that they might be overheard
up above. Her husband seized her uplifted arm,
signed to her to sniff, and then blew into her wide
open mouth the word: "<i>Risotto</i>."</p>

<p>She hesitated, not having heard distinctly.
Pasotti shrugged his shoulders. "She don't
understand anything," said he. "The weather
is going to change," and he went up stairs, followed
by his wife. The stout curate wished to take
another look at Don Franco's boat. "The Carabellis,
indeed!" he mused, but he was immediately
recalled by Signora Barborin, who begged him
to sit beside her at the table; she was so timid,
poor creature!</p>

<p>The fumes of the pots and kettles filled the stairs
with warm fragrance. "It is not <i>risotto</i>," the
vanguard murmured. "It is <i>risotto</i>," the rearguard
answered in the same tone. And thus they
continued, ever more softly: "It is not <i>risotto</i>;
it is <i>risotto</i>," until Pasotti pushed open the door
of the red room, where the mistress of the house
was usually to be found.</p>

<p>A hideous, lean, little dog trotted, barking,
towards Signora Barborin, who was endeavouring
to smile, while Pasotti was putting on his most
obsequious expression, and the curate, entering
last, his big face all sweetness, was really, in his
heart, consigning the cursed little beast to hell.</p>

<p>"Friend, come here, Friend!" the old Marchesa
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
said placidly. "Dear Signora, dear Controllore,
and the curate!"</p>

<p>Her gruff nasal voice was pitched in the same
calm tone to the guests and to the dog. She
had risen to receive Signora Barborin, but did not
move a step from the sofa, and stood there, a
squat figure, with dull, torpid eyes beneath her
marble forehead, and her black wig, which rounded
out over her temples in the shape of two big snails.
Her face must once have been handsome, and still
retained in its pallor, tinged with yellow like old
marble, a certain cold majesty, which&mdash;like her
glance and her voice&mdash;never varied with the varying
emotions of her soul. The big curate, standing
at a distance, made her two or three jerky bows,
but Pasotti kissed her hand, while Signora Barborin,
who felt her blood turn to ice under the old
lady's lifeless glance, did not know how to move,
nor what to say. Another lady had risen from
the sofa when the Marchesa rose, and was staring
with an insolent air at Signora Pasotti, at that
poor little bundle, old within, and new without!
"Signora Pasotti and her husband," said the
Marchesa. "Donna Eugenia Carabelli."</p>

<p>Donna Eugenia hardly bowed her head. Her
daughter, Donna Carolina, was standing at the
window, talking with one of the Marchesa's
favourites, the niece of the agent.</p>

<p>The Marchesa did not consider it necessary to
disturb her in order to present the new arrivals,
and when she had invited them to be seated, she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
resumed her quiet conversation with Donna
Eugenia concerning mutual friends in Milan,
while Friend, sniffing and sneezing, circled slowly
round Signora Barborin's shawl, which smelt of
camphor, or rubbed himself against the curate's
calves, studying Pasotti the while, with those
pitiful, watery eyes of his, but never once touching
him, as if he understood that the master of that
Indian shawl, in spite of his amiable expression,
would have liked to ring his&mdash;Friend's&mdash;neck!</p>

<p>And the Marchesa Orsola talked on in her usual
guttural, sleepy voice, and Donna Carabelli, in
answering, strove to give her loud, imperious
voice an amiable ring. But to Pasotti's penetrating
glance, and cunning shrewdness it was
quite clear that the two old ladies were concealing
a certain dissatisfaction, which was greater in
the Marchesa Maironi than in Donna Eugenia.
Every time the door opened the dim eyes of the
one and the dark eyes of the other were turned
in that direction. Once it admitted the prefect
of the <i>Santuario della Caravina</i>, with little Signor
Paolo Sala, called <i>el Paolin</i>&mdash;little Paul&mdash;and
Signor Paolo Pozzi, called <i>el Paolon</i>&mdash;big Paul&mdash;who
were inseparable companions. Again there
entered the Marchese Bianchi, of Oria, a former
officer of the kingdom of Italy, with his daughter.
He was a noble type of the gallant, old soldier, as
he stood beside the attractive and vivacious
young girl.</p>

<p>On both occasions a shadow of vexation passed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
over Donna Carabelli's face. Her daughter also
turned her eyes swiftly towards the door when it
was thrown open, but presently she would begin
chatting and laughing again, more gaily than ever.</p>

<p>"And Don Franco, Marchesa? How is Don
Franco?" said the cunning Pasotti, in a mellifluous
voice, as he offered his open snuff-box to
his hostess.</p>

<p>"Thank you," the Marchesa answered, bending
forward a little and dipping her fingers into the
snuff. "Franco? To tell the truth I am rather
anxious about him. This morning he was not
feeling very well, and he has not appeared yet.
I trust&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don Franco?" said the Marchese. "He is out
in his boat. We saw him a few minutes ago,
rowing like any boatman."</p>

<p>Donna Eugenia spread her fan open.</p>

<p>"Well done!" said she, fanning furiously. "A
most delightful pastime." Then she closed the
fan with a bang, and began biting at it with
her lips.</p>

<p>"Probably he needed the air," the Marchesa
observed, in her unruffled, nasal drawl.</p>

<p>"Probably he needed a wetting," the prefect
of the Caravina murmured, his eyes sparkling with
fun. "It is raining!"</p>

<p>"Don Franco is coming now, Signora Marchesa,"
said the agent's niece, after a glance at the lake.</p>

<p>"That is good," the sleepy, nasal drawl replied.
"I hope he is feeling better. If not, he will not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
speak two words. He is a perfectly healthy boy,
but very apprehensive about himself. By the
way, Signor Controllore, why does not Signor
Giacomo make his appearance?"</p>

<p>"<i>El sior Zacomo</i>," Pasotti began, in imitation
of Signor Giacomo Puttini, an old bachelor from
the Veneto, who had lived at Albogasio Superiore,
near Villa Pasotti, for the last thirty years. "<i>El
sior Zacomo</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" said the old lady, interrupting
him. "I cannot allow you to make fun of the
Venetians, and besides, it is not true that they
say <i>Zacomo</i> in the Veneto."</p>

<p>She herself was a native of Padua, and although
she had lived in Brescia for half a century, still
her Lombard accent was not entirely free from
certain chronic suggestions of her Paduan origin.
While Pasotti was protesting, with ceremonial
horror, that he had only intended to imitate the
voice of his beloved friend and neighbour, the
door opened a third time. Donna Eugenia, well
aware who was coming, did not condescend to
look round, but the Marchesa allowed her dull
eyes to rest on Don Franco with the greatest
unconcern.</p>

<p>Don Franco, sole heir to the name of Maironi,
was the son of the Marchesa's son who had died
when only eight-and-twenty. He had lost his
mother at his birth, and had always lived under
the rule of his grandmother Maironi. He was
tall and slender, and wore a tangle of rather
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
long, dark hair, and this had procured for
him the nickname of <i>el scovin d'i nivol</i>, "the cloud
sweeper." He had eloquent, light blue eyes, a
keen, animated and pleasing face, quick to blush
or turn pale. Now that frowning face was saying
very plainly: "Here I am, but I am much put
out!"</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Franco?" his grandmother
inquired, and added quickly, without waiting for
an answer: "Donna Carolina is anxious to hear
that piece by Kalkbrenner."</p>

<p>"Oh! not at all!" said the girl, turning to the
young man with an air of indifference. "I did
indeed say so, but then I am not fond of Kalkbrenner,
I had much rather chat with the young
ladies."</p>

<p>Franco seemed quite satisfied with the reception
he had received and, without waiting for
further remarks, went over to talk with the big
curate about a fine old picture they were to inspect
together, in the church at Dasio. Donna Eugenia
Carabelli was quivering with indignation.
She had come from Loveno, with her daughter,
after certain secret diplomatic transactions, in
which other powers had had a hand. Should
this visit be paid or not; would the dignity of the
house of Carabelli permit it; did that probability
of success which Donna Eugenia exacted, really
exist? Such were the final questions, which
diplomacy had been called upon to answer, for,
notwithstanding the acquaintance of long standing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which existed between Mamma Carabelli and
Grandmamma Maironi, the young people had
met only once or twice, and then but for a few
minutes. They were being drawn together by
their surroundings of wealth and nobility, of
relationships and friendships, as a drop of salt
water and a drop of fresh water are mutually
drawn together, though the microscopic creatures,
which have their being in the one and in the other
be condemned to perish if the two drops mingle.
The Marchesa had carried her point. It had been
decided&mdash;apparently out of respect for her age,
but really out of respect for her money&mdash;that
the interview should take place at Cressogno;
for, though Franco himself was possessed
only of his mother's modest fortune, amounting
to eighteen or twenty thousand Austrian <i>lire</i>,
his grandmother was enthroned in all her calm
dignity upon several millions. And now Donna
Eugenia, observing the young man's conduct,
was furious with the Marchesa, as well as
with those who had exposed her daughter
and herself to such humiliation. If, at a single
blow, she could have swept away the old
woman, her grandson, the gloomy house and
the tiresome company, she would have done so
with joy; but she must hide her feelings, feign
indifference, swallow the indignity and the dinner.</p>

<p>The Marchesa preserved her external, marble
placidity, though her heart was filled with anger
and rancour against her grandson. Two years before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
he had dared to ask her consent to his marriage
with a young girl of Valsolda, of good family, but
neither rich nor of noble birth. His grandmother's
decided refusal had rendered the union
impossible, and indeed the girl's mother had felt
obliged to forbid Don Franco the house; but the
Marchesa was convinced that those people still
had their eyes on her millions. She had therefore
determined to find a wife for Franco, at once, in
order to avert all danger. She had sought for a
girl who should be rich, but not too rich; of noble,
but not too noble birth; intelligent, but not too
intelligent. Having discovered one of the right
sort, she suggested her to Franco who flew into a
rage, and declared he had no desire to marry.
The answer had a very suspicious ring, and she
redoubled her vigilance, watching every movement
of her grandson and of that "Madam Trap,"
that being the pleasing title she had bestowed
upon Signorina Luisa Rigey.</p>

<p>The Rigey family, consisting of the two ladies
only, lived at Castello, in Valsolda, so it was not
difficult to watch their movements. Nevertheless
the Marchesa could not discover anything. But
one evening Pasotti told her, with much hypocritical
hesitation and many horrified comments,
that the prefect of the Caravina, while chatting
with Pasotti himself, with Signor Giacomo Puttini
and with Paolin and Paolon, in the chemist's
shop at San Mamette, had made the following
remark: "Don Franco is going to keep quiet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
until the old lady is really dead!" The Marchesa
having listened to this delicate piece of wit,
answered: "A thousand thanks!" through her
placid nose, and changed the subject. Later she
learned that Signora Rigey&mdash;always more or less
of an invalid&mdash;was suffering from hypertrophia
of the heart, and it appeared to her that Franco's
spirits were much affected by this illness. It was
then that Signorina Carabelli was suggested to her.
Carolina Carabelli was perhaps not entirely to her
taste, but with that other danger threatening she
could not hesitate. She spoke to Franco. This
time he did not fly into a rage, but listened in an
absent-minded way, and said he would think the
matter over. This was perhaps the one act of
hypocrisy of his whole life. Then the Marchesa
boldly played a high card, and sent for the
Carabellis.</p>

<p>She saw plainly enough now, that the game was
lost. Don Franco had not been present when the
ladies arrived, and later had appeared only once
for a few minutes. During those few minutes
his manner had been gracious, but not so his
expression. As usual his face had spoken so
plainly that&mdash;though the Marchesa immediately
invented an indisposition for him&mdash;no one could
have been deceived. But in spite of all this, the
old lady was not convinced that she had played
her cards unskilfully. Ever since she had reached
the age of discretion it had been a rule with her
never to recognise in herself a single defect or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
mistake, never wittingly to wound her own noble
and beloved self. Now she preferred to believe
that, after her sermon on matrimony, some
honeyed but poisonous and ensnaring word had
mysteriously reached her grandson. If her disappointment
was somewhat mitigated, this was
due to the conduct of Signorina Carabelli, whose
lively resentment was but ill concealed. This
was not pleasing to the Marchesa. The prefect
of the Caravina was not mistaken&mdash;though he
perhaps erred slightly in the form of his discourse,
when he said, softly, of her: "She is Austria itself."
Like the old Austria of those days, the old Marchesa
did not wish for any bold spirits in her
empire. Her own iron will would not tolerate
others in its neighbourhood. Such an indocile
Lombardy-Venice as was Franco was already too
much, and the Carabelli girl, who appeared
to have a mind and a will of her own, would
probably prove a troublesome subject of the
house of Maironi, a species of turbulent Hungary.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced. The footman's shaven
face, and ill-fitting, grey livery reflected the Marchesa's
aristocratic tastes, which, however, had
been tempered by habits of economy.</p>

<p>"And where is this Signor Giacomo, Controllore?"
she said, without rising.</p>

<p>"I fear he is not coming, Marchesa," Pasotti
replied. "I saw him this morning, and said to
him: 'Then we shall meet at dinner, Signor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Giacomo?' But he squirmed as if he had
swallowed a snake. He twisted and turned and
at last puffed out: 'Yes, probably. I don't
know! Perhaps. I can't say!&mdash;Uff! uff. Well
really now, my good Controllore, indeed I don't
know!&mdash;Uff, uff!'&mdash;and I could get nothing more
out of him."</p>

<p>The Marchesa summoned the footman to her
side, and gave him an order in a low tone. He
bowed and withdrew. In his longing for the
risotto, the curate of Puria was rocking his body
to and fro, and stroking his knees. But the Marchesa
on her sofa, seemed turned to stone, so he
also became petrified. The others gazed mutely
at one another.</p>

<p>Poor Signora Barborin, who had seen the footman,
and was surprised at this immobility and
these astonished faces, arched her eyebrows,
questioning with her eyes, first her husband, then
Puria, then the prefect, until a lightning glance
from Pasotti petrified her as well. "Perhaps
the dinner is burnt!" she reflected, assuming an
expression of indifference. "If they would only
send us home! What luck that would be!" But
in a minute or two the servant returned, and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Let us go," the Marchesa said, rising.</p>

<p>In the dining-room the company found a new
personage; a little, crooked, old man, with kind
eyes and a long nose, that drooped towards
his chin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
    "Indeed, Signora Marchesa," he began, humbly
and timidly, "I have already dined."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Signor Viscontini," the Marchesa
replied, who, like all those who are determined
to make their world bend to their own comfort
and tastes, was well versed in the insolent art
of feigning deafness.</p>

<p>The little man did not dare to answer, neither
did he dare to sit down.</p>

<p>"Courage, Signor Viscontini!" said Paolin,
who stood near him. "What are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"He is filling a gap!" muttered the prefect.
In fact, the excellent Signor Viscontini, by trade
a tuner of pianos, had that morning come from
Lugano to tune the Zelbis' piano at Cima, and
Don Franco's also, and at one o'clock he had dined
at Casa Zelbi. Then he had come to Villa Maironi,
and was now called upon to act as substitute
for Signor Giacomo, because, without him, the
company would have numbered thirteen.</p>

<p>A brown liquid was smoking in the silver soup-tureen.</p>

<p>"It is not risotto!" Pasotti whispered to Puria,
passing behind him. But the big, mild face
gave no sign of having heard.</p>

<p>The Casa Maironi dinners were always lugubrious
affairs, and this one promised to be more
than usually so. But as a compensation, it was
much finer than usual. While they were eating,
Pasotti and Puria often exchanged glances of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
admiration, as if congratulating one another on
the exquisite delight they were enjoying; and if
ever Puria failed to catch one of Pasotti's glances,
Signora Barborin, seated beside him, would apprise
him of it by a timid touch of her elbow.</p>

<p>The voices which predominated were those of
the Marchesa and Donna Eugenia. Bianchi's
large aristocratic nose, and his shrewd but gallant
and courteous smile were often turned towards
the lady's beauty, which though already fading,
had not, as yet, departed. Both belonged to
Milanese families of the best blood, and were
united by a certain sense of superiority, not only
over the other middle-class guests, but over their
hosts as well, whose nobility was only provincial.
The Marchese was affability itself, and would have
conversed amiably with the humblest of his fellow-guests,
but Donna Eugenia, in the bitterness of
her soul, in her disgust for the place and the
persons, attached herself to him as to the only
one worthy of her attention, markedly singling
him out, in order, also, to offend the others. She
embarrassed him by remarking in a loud tone
that she did not see how he could ever have taken
a fancy to this odious Valsolda. The Marchese,
who for many years had led a life of quiet and
retirement in this region, where, moreover, the
birth of his only daughter, Donna Ester, had taken
place, was, first, greatly disconcerted, for this
remark was calculated to wound several of their
fellow-guests; but finally he burst into a brilliant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
defence of the place. The Marchesa showed no
feeling; Paolin, Paolon, and the prefect, all natives
of Valsolda, were silent and abashed.</p>

<p>Then, in pompous language, Pasotti sang the
praises of Niscioree, the villa belonging to Bianchi,
near Oria. These praises did not seem to please
the Marchese, who, himself a most loyal man, had
not always found Pasotti to his liking, in the past.
He invited Donna Carabelli to come to Niscioree.
"You must not go on foot, Eugenia," said the
Marchesa, well aware that her friend was tormented
by the fear of growing stout. "The road
from the Custom House to Niscioree is so narrow!
You could not possibly pass." Donna Eugenia
protested hotly. "It is not, indeed, the
Corso of Porta Renza," said the Marchese, "but
neither is it <i>le chemin du Paradis</i>&mdash;unfortunately!"</p>

<p>"That it is not! Most certainly not! You may take
my word for it!" exclaimed Viscontini, heated, as
ill luck would have it, by too many glasses
of Ghemme. All eyes were turned upon him,
and Paolin said something to him in a low tone.
"Crazy?" the little man retorted, his face aflame.
"Not by any means! I tell you&mdash;&mdash;" And
here he related how, coming from Lugano that
morning, he had felt cold in the boat, and had
gotten out at Niscioree, intending to pursue his
journey on foot; how there, between those two
walls, where the path was so narrow an ass could
not turn round in it, he had met the customs-officers,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
who had first abused him for getting out
at Niscioree, and had then taken him back to the
beastly custom-house. He said that beast of a
Ricevitore&mdash;the receiver of customs&mdash;had confiscated
a roll of manuscript music he had with
him, taking the crotchets and quavers for a secret
political correspondence.</p>

<p>Profound silence followed this recital. Presently
the Marchesa declared that Signor Viscontini
was entirely in the wrong. He should not
have landed at Niscioree; it was forbidden. As
to the Ricevitore, he was a most worthy man.
Pasotti, with a solemn face, confirmed this
statement.</p>

<p>"Excellent official," said he. "Excellent rascal!"
muttered the prefect between his teeth.
Franco, who at first appeared to be thinking of
something else, roused himself, and cast a contemptuous
glance at Pasotti.</p>

<p>"After all," the Marchesa added, "it seems
to me that, in the disguise of manuscript music,
there might easily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Paolin, who played the Austrian
from fear while the mistress of the house
was Austrian from conviction.</p>

<p>The Marchese, who in 1815 had broken his
sword in two that he might not be obliged to serve
the Austrians, smiled saying quietly: "<i>La! C'est
un peu fort!</i>"</p>

<p>"But every one knows that the Ricevitore is a
beast!" Franco exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
    "I beg to differ with you, Don Franco," said
Pasotti.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; beg to differ!" the other retorted.
"He is a perfect beast!"</p>

<p>"He is a conscientious man," said the Marchesa,
"an official who does his duty."</p>

<p>"Then his masters are the beasts!" Franco exclaimed.</p>

<p>"My dear Franco!" drawled the emotionless
voice, "I will not tolerate such language in my
house! Thank God we are not in Piedmont!"
Pasotti grinned his approval. Then Franco,
lifting his plate with both hands shivered it upon
the table, with a furious blow. "Holy Mother!"
gasped Viscontini, and Paolon, interrupted in
the laborious operations of a toothless glutton,
uttered an exclamation of alarm. "Yes, yes!"
said Franco, rising, his face distorted, "I had
better go!" And he left the room. Donna Eugenia
at once turned faint, and had to be led away.
All the ladies, except Signora Pasotti, followed
her out at one door, while the footman entered
at another, bearing a great risotto pie. Puria
cast a triumphant glance at Pasotti, but Pasotti
pretended not to notice. All had risen. Viscontini,
the apparent culprit, kept repeating: "I
can't make it out! I can't make it out!" and
Paolin, much vexed at seeing the dinner thus
interrupted, grumbled at him: "What business
have you to try to make anything out?" The
Marchese was frowning fiercely, but kept silent.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
At last Pasotti, the real culprit, assuming an
air of affectionate sadness, said, as if speaking
to himself: "What a pity! Poor Don Franco!
A heart of gold, a good head, but such a disposition!
It is indeed unfortunate."</p>

<p>"Alas!" exclaimed Paolin, and Puria added
despairingly: "Truly a great misfortune!"</p>

<p>They waited and waited, but the ladies did not
return. Then some one moved. Paolin and
Puria, their hands clasped behind them, walked
slowly towards the sideboard, lost in contemplation
of the risotto pie. Puria called sweetly
to Pasotti, but Pasotti did not move. "I only
wished to observe," the big curate said, hiding
his triumph so that it might or might not be
apparent, "I only wished to observe that there
are white truffles in it."</p>

<p>"I should say that black truffles<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4">
    </a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> are not
wanting here either," remarked the Marchese
pointedly, and slightly accentuating the words.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
ON THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW LIFE</h2>

<p>"Scoundrels!" snorted Don Franco, climbing
the stairs that led to his room. "Silly
ass of an Austrian!" He was venting his wrath
on Pasotti, as he could not hurl insults at his
grandmother, and the very letters of the word
<i>Austrian</i> served so well to grind between his teeth,
as he ground his rage, crushing it and enjoying
its flavour. When he reached his room his burning
indignation died out.</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair opposite the open
window, and gazed at the lake, lying still and
mournful in the cloudy afternoon, and at the lonely
mountains beyond the sheet of water. He drew
a long breath. Ah! how well he felt here all alone!
Ah! what peace! How different the atmosphere
was to that of the drawing-room! What a precious
atmosphere, full of his thoughts and of his loves!
He felt a great need of giving himself up to them,
and they at once took possession of him, driving
from his mind the Carabellis, Pasotti, his grandmother
and that egregious beast, the receiver of
customs. They? No, one thought alone; a
thought composed of mingled love and reason,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of anxiety and joy, of so many sweet memories,
and at the same time, of tremulous expectancy,
for something solemn was drawing near, and
would come to him in the shadows of the night.
Franco looked at his watch. It wanted a quarter
to four o'clock. Seven hours longer to wait. He
rose, and leaned with folded arms upon the window
sill.</p>

<p>In seven hours another life would begin for him.
Beyond the few persons who were to have a part
in the event, not even the air itself knew
that that same evening, towards eleven o'clock,
Don Franco Maironi would wed Signorina Luisa
Rigey.</p>

<p>For some time Signora Teresa Rigey, Luisa's
mother, had, in all sincerity, begged Franco to
bend to his grandmother's will, to abstain from
visiting their house, and to think no more of Luisa,
who, on her part, was content, for the dignity of
the family, and out of respect for her mother, that
all official relations with Don Franco should cease.
She did not, however, doubt that he would remain
faithful to her, and considered herself bound to
him for life. His grandmother was not aware
that he was now privately reading law, in order
that by following a profession, he might be able
to maintain himself. But, as a result of so much
anxiety, Signora Rigey contracted a heart trouble,
which grew suddenly worse towards the end of
August, 1851. Franco wrote to her, begging to
be allowed at least, to visit her, since it was not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
possible for him to nurse her "as would have been
his duty." The lady did not feel justified in
consenting to this, and the young man, in despair,
gave her to understand that he looked upon Luisa
as his affianced wife before God, and that he would
rather die than to give her up. Then the poor
mother, conscious that her life was ebbing day
by day, distressed by the uncertain position of
her beloved child, and convinced of the young
man's strength of purpose, conceived a great
longing that&mdash;as the marriage would surely take
place&mdash;it should be celebrated as soon as possible.
Everything was arranged in haste, with the aid
of the curate of Castello and of Signora Rigey's
brother, the civil engineer Ribera, of Oria, who
was in the service of the Imperial and Royal
Office of Public Works, at Como. The understanding
was as follows: The marriage should
be celebrated secretly; Franco should remain with
his grandmother, and Luisa with her mother,
until such a time as they should deem it opportune
to acknowledge their union to the Marchesa.
Franco relied greatly upon the support of Monsignor
Benaglia, Bishop of Lodi, and an old friend of
the family, but before he was asked to interfere,
the decisive step must be taken. If (as in all
probability would be the case) the Marchesa
hardened her heart against them, the young couple
and Signora Rigey would take up their abode in
a house in Oria, belonging to the engineer Ribera,
a bachelor who was supporting his sister's family,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and would now accept Franco in place of a
son.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In seven hours then!</p>

<p>The window overlooked the landing-place and
the strip of garden in front of the villa, on the lake
side. When he first fell in love, Franco used to
stand there and watch for the coming of a certain
boat, from which would spring a slim little person,
as light as air, but who never, never looked towards
his window. At last, one day he had gone
down to meet her, and she had waited a moment
before jumping out, that she might accept his helping
hand&mdash;which, indeed, was most unnecessary.
Down there in the garden he had given her a
flower, for the first time, the sweet-smelling flower
of the <i>Mandevilia suaveolens</i>. Down there, on
another occasion, he had cut his finger rather
deeply with his penknife, while gathering a little
branch of roses for her, and she, by the anxiety
she displayed, had given him a sweet proof of
her love. How many excursions to the solitary
slopes of Monte Bisgnago, on the other side, he
had made with her and with other friends,
before his grandmother found out! How many
lunches and suppers at the little inn at Doi!
Franco would come home with the sweetness of
the many glances exchanged still lingering in his
heart, and shutting himself up in his room, would
recall them all, revelling in them in memory.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
These first emotions of his love now rushed into
his mind, not one by one, but all together, from
the waters and from the gloomy shores, where his
fixed gaze seemed to lose itself in the shadowy
past rather than in the misty present. Thus, as
he neared the goal, he thought of the first steps
he had taken on this long road, of the unforeseen
incidents, of the aspect of this much-longed-for
union, so different in reality from what it had
appeared in his dreams. He looked back upon
the time of the <i>mandevilia</i> and the roses, of the
excursions on the lake and among the hills.
Certainly, at that time, he did not dream he would
attain his object thus, secretly, and surrounded
by so many difficulties, so much pain. Still, he
thought that if the wedding had taken place
openly, with the customary proem of official ceremonies,
of contracts, congratulations, visits, and
dinners, all this would have been even more
wearisome and repugnant to his love than the
opposition he had met with.</p>

<p>He was aroused by the voice of the prefect,
calling to him from the garden, to announce the
departure of the Carabellis. Franco reflected
that if he went down he would be obliged to offer
some apologies, and he preferred not to make his
appearance. "You should have smashed the
plate on his face!" the prefect called up to him,
his hands framing his mouth. "You should have
smashed it on his face!"</p>

<p>Then he turned away, and Franco saw the Carabellis'
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
boatman go down to the shore to prepare
the boat. He left the window, and returning
to the thoughts which had occupied him first of
all, he opened his chest of drawers, and stood
absently contemplating an embroidered shirt
front, where certain small diamond studs his father
had worn at his own wedding, were already sparkling.
He disliked the idea of going to the altar
without some outward sign of festivity, but of
course, this sign must not be too apparent.</p>

<p>In the iris-scented chest of drawers everything
was arranged with that order which denotes a
cultured spirit, and no one was allowed to touch its
contents save Franco himself. But the chairs, the
writing table, the piano, were heaped with such
disorder that it would seem as if a hurricane of
books and papers had swept in at the two windows.
Certain law books were slumbering under an inch
of dust, but not a single leaf of the little gardenia,
growing in a pot on the sill of the east window,
showed a speck of dust. These indications were
sufficient to suggest the whimsical rule of a poet.
A glance at the books and papers would have
given conclusive proof of this.</p>

<p>Franco was passionately fond of poetry, and
was a true poet in the exquisite delicacy of his instincts.
As a writer of verse he could be ranked only
as an indifferent amateur, wanting in originality.
His favourite models were Foscolo and Giusti.
He worshipped them fervently, and pillaged them
both, for his genius, which was both satirical and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
enthusiastic, was not capable of creating a style of
its own, and must content itself with imitating
others. It is only fair to remark that young men
in those days generally possessed a classical
culture such as has since become most exceptional,
and that through the classics themselves they
learned to respect the art of imitation, as a praiseworthy
and virtuous practice.</p>

<p>Franco liked to improvise on the piano with
some of these verses before his eyes. Even more
devoted to music than to poetry, he had himself
purchased this piano for one hundred and fifty
<i>svanziche</i>, from the organist at Loggio, because
the poor Viennese instrument, belonging to his
grandmother, which was always wrapped up and
must be handled carefully, like a gouty member
of the family, was not adapted to his requirements.
The organist's instrument, which had
been thumped and banged upon by two generations
of hands, hardened by contact with the
pickaxe, now sent forth only a funny little nasal
voice, which rose above a faint tinkling, as of
many tiny glasses standing too close together.
Franco was almost oblivious to this. As soon as
he had placed his hands upon the instrument his
imagination would take fire; the composer's
enthusiasm would enter into him, and, in the heat
of the creative passion, a thread of sound sufficed
to permeate him with the spirit of music, and
absolutely to intoxicate him. An Erard would
have embarrassed him, would have left less room
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for fancy, would, in a word, have been less dear
to him than his spinet.</p>

<p>Franco possessed too many talents, too many
different inclinations, too much impetuosity, too
little vanity and perhaps also, too little will-power
to undertake that tiresome, methodical,
manual labour, which is indispensable in order to
become a pianist. Nevertheless, Viscontini was
enthusiastic about the style of playing, and his
fiancée Luisa, though she did not entirely share
his classical tastes, honestly admired his touch.
When, being pressed to do so, he would make the
organ at Cressogno roar and groan in the approved
classic manner, the good people, overwhelmed
by the music and the honour, would stare at him
with open mouths and reverent eyes, as they
would have stared at some preacher, whose
sermon they did not understand. But notwithstanding
all this, Franco could not have held his
own in a city drawing-room, against the majority
of feeble amateurs, incapable even of understanding
and loving music. All, or almost all of
them would have shown themselves his superiors
in agility and in precision, and would have
gathered in more applause, even though no one of
them had succeeded in making the piano sing
as he made it sing, especially in the adagios of
Bellini and of Beethoven, playing with his soul
in his throat, in his eyes, in the muscles of his face,
in the tendons of his hands, which seemed one
with the chords of the piano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
    Another passion of his was for old pictures.
The walls of his room held several, most of which
were daubs. Never having travelled he had
little experience. His fancy was quick to take
fire, and, obliged as he was to fit his ample desires
to his scant means, he was credulous concerning
the alleged good fortune of other ignorant purchasers,
and often allowed himself to be influenced
by them, to be blinded and led into buying certain
dirty rags, which, if they cost little, were worth
still less. The only passably good things he
possessed were a head, in the style of Morone,
and a Madonna and Child, after the manner of
Carlo Dolci. Franco, however, baptised these
two little pictures with the names of Morone and
Carlo Dolci, without further qualification.</p>

<p>When he had re-read and enjoyed some lines
inspired by the hypocritical Pasotti, he once
more hunted in the chaos of his desk, and drew
forth a small sheet of notepaper, upon which he
intended to write to Monsignor Benaglia, the only
person who, in the future, might be able to influence
his grandmother in his favour. He felt
it his duty to inform him of the step he was about
to take, of the reasons which had forced his
fiancée and himself to resort to this painful subterfuge,
of the hope they cherished that he would
help them when the time came to confess all to
the Marchesa. He was still reflecting, pen in
hand, when the Carabellis' boat passed beneath
his window. Soon after he heard the Marchese's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
gondola glide by, followed presently by Pin's boat.
He expected that his grandmother would send for
him, now that she was alone, but she did not do
so. He waited some time, expecting to be summoned,
then he began to think of his letter again,
and reflected so long, re-wrote the introduction
so many times, and got on so slowly, that before
he had finished he was obliged to light the lamp.</p>

<p>The end was easier. He begged the old Bishop's
prayers for his Luisa and for himself, and expressed
a faith in God so perfect and so pure, that
the most unbelieving heart must have been
touched by it.</p>

<p>Fiery and impetuous as he was, still Franco
possessed the calm and simple faith of a little
child. Entirely free from pride, a stranger to
philosophical meditations, he was ignorant of
that thirst for intellectual liberty which torments
young men, when their senses begin to find themselves
hampered by that strong curb&mdash;positive
beliefs. He had never for an instant doubted
his religion, and performed all the duties it prescribed
without once asking himself if it be reasonable
to act and believe thus. Still he had nothing
of the mystic or of the ascetic. His intellect,
though ardent and poetic, was, at the same time,
clear and positive. Devoted as he was to nature
and to art, and attracted by all the pleasing
aspects of life, he would naturally shrink from
mysticism. He had not acquired his faith; he
had never concentrated all his thoughts upon it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
for any length of time, therefore it was not possible
that it should have penetrated all his sentiments.
Religion was to him what science is to
the student, whose first thought is school, where
he studies diligently, having no peace until he has
done his home tasks, and is prepared for the next
lesson, but who, once his duty is performed, thinks
no more either of teachers or of books, and does
not feel the need of regulating his actions according
to scientific conclusions or scholastic programmes.
Therefore it would often seem that
Franco's life was influenced by nothing else than
his warm and generous heart, his passionate
inclinations, his lively impressions, and the impulses
of his honest nature, which was offended
by every kind of untruth and meanness, while
he chafed under contradiction, and was incapable
of deceit.</p>

<p>He had just sealed his letter when some one
knocked at the door. The Marchesa had sent to
summon Don Franco downstairs to recite the
Rosary. At Casa Maironi they recited the Rosary
every evening between seven and eight, and the
servants were obliged to be present. The Marchesa
herself intoned the prayers, enthroned on
her sofa, her sleepy eyes roving over the backs
and legs of the worshippers, kneeling, some in
one position, some in another, some in the light
best adapted to set off a devotional attitude, and
others in the shadow which would favour a comfortable,
but forbidden nap. Franco entered the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
room as the nasal voice was repeating the sweet
words: "<i>Ave Maria, gratia <a name="piena" id="piena"></a>plena</i>," with that
drawling unction which always inspired him with
a wild desire to become a Turk. The young man
flung himself down in a dark corner, and never
opened his lips. It was impossible for him to
answer that irritating voice with fitting devotion.
He fell to imagining what the coming interview
would be like, and preparing caustic answers.</p>

<p>When the Rosary was finished the Marchesa
waited a moment and then pronounced the words
consecrated by long usage&mdash;</p>

<p>"Carlotta, Friend."</p>

<p>It was the duty of Carlotta, the Marchesa's
old maid, to take Friend in her arms, and carry
him off to bed, as soon as the Rosary was
finished.</p>

<p>"He is here, Signora Marchesa," said Carlotta.</p>

<p>But Friend, though indeed he had been there,
was somewhere else when she bent down with
outstretched hand. That evening old Friend
was in good spirits, and determined to play at not
being caught. He would tempt Carlotta, and
then slip through her fingers, taking refuge under
the piano, or under the table, from whence he
would peer out at the poor woman with ironical
waggings of his tail, while Carlotta's lips said,
"Come, come, dear!" and her heart said, "Ugly
beast!"</p>

<p>"Friend!" exclaimed the Marchesa. "That
will do, Friend! Be good!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
    Franco was boiling. The nasty little monster,
imbued with his mistress' arrogance and egotism,
paused at his feet, and Franco rolled him roughly
towards Carlotta, who grabbed him, and punished
him with an angry squeeze, and then carried him
off, answering his whines with deceitful words
of pity. "What did they do to you, poor Friend?
What did they do to you? Tell us all about it!"</p>

<p>The Marchesa made no remarks, nor did her
marble countenance betray her feelings. She
ordered the footman to tell the prefect of the
Caravina, or any one else who might call, that his
mistress had retired. Franco started to leave
the room behind the servants, but checked himself
at once, that he might not appear to be running
away. He took a number of the <i>Imperial and
Royal Gazette</i> of Milan from the mantel-shelf, and
seating himself near his grandmother, began
reading while he waited.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you heartily on the good manners
and fine sentiments you displayed to us
to-day," the sleepy voice began, almost immediately.</p>

<p>"I accept your congratulations," Franco retorted,
without raising his eyes from his paper.</p>

<p>"Well done, my dear!" his immovable grandmother
replied, and added: "I am glad that young
girl had the opportunity of seeing you as you are,
because, supposing she may have heard of a certain
project, she will now be very glad it is no
longer thought of."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
    "Then we are both satisfied!" said Franco.</p>

<p>"You cannot in the least tell if you are going
to be satisfied. Especially if you still hold the
views you once held."</p>

<p>Upon this, Franco put his paper down, and
looked his grandmother full in the face.</p>

<p>"What would happen," he said, "if I still held
the same views I once held?"</p>

<p>This time he did not speak in a challenging tone,
but with quiet seriousness.</p>

<p>"Ah! That is right!" the Marchesa exclaimed.
"Let us speak plainly! I hope and believe that
a certain event will never take place, but should it
take place, do not flatter yourself that there will
be anything for you at my death, for I have already
arranged matters so that there will be
nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh! as to that&mdash;&mdash;" the young man began,
with indifference.</p>

<p>"That is the score you would have to settle
with me," the Marchesa continued. "Then there
would be a score to settle with God."</p>

<p>"How is that?" Franco questioned. "God
shall come first with me, and you afterwards!"</p>

<p>When the Marchesa was caught in a mistake
she always talked straight on as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>"And it will be a heavy score," said she.</p>

<p>"But it must be settled first!" Franco insisted.</p>

<p>"Because," the formidable old woman continued,
"a good Christian is in duty bound to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
obey his father and his mother, and I represent
both your father and your mother."</p>

<p>If the one was obstinate, the other was no
less so.</p>

<p>"But God comes first!" said he.</p>

<p>The Marchesa rang the bell and closed the
conversation thus&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we understand each other perfectly."</p>

<p>When Carlotta entered she rose from the sofa,
and said, placidly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night," Franco answered, and resumed
the <i>Milan Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as his grandmother had left the room
he flung the paper aside, clenched his fists, and
giving vent to his anger in a sort of furious snort,
sprang to his feet, saying aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! It is better so! Better, better so!"
It was better so, he continued to assure himself
mutely. Better never to bring Luisa to this
accursed house, better never to oblige her to bear
this rule, this arrogance, this voice, this face!
Better to live on bread and water, and look to
hard work for the rest, rather than to accept
anything from his grandmother's hand. Better
become a gardener, d&mdash;&mdash; it! a boatman, or a
charcoal burner!</p>

<p>He went up to his room determined to break
with all obligations. "A score to settle with
God!" he exclaimed, banging the door behind
him. "A score to settle with God if I marry
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Luisa! Ah! after all, what do I care? Let them
see me, spy upon me, bring her the news. Let
them tell her, let them sing it to her in every key.
I shall be delighted!"</p>

<p>He dressed himself in feverish haste, knocking
against the chairs, and closing the drawers with
a bang. In his recklessness he put on a black
suit, went noisily downstairs, called the old footman,
told him he should be out all night, and, not
heeding the half-astonished, half-terrified face
of the poor fellow, who was devoted to him,
rushed into the street, and was lost in the darkness.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>He had been gone two or three minutes when
the Marchesa, who was already in bed, sent Carlotta
to see who had come running downstairs.
Carlotta reported that it was Don Franco, and
was at once dispatched again on a second errand.
"What did Don Franco want?" This time the
answer was, that Don Franco had gone out for
a few moments. The "few moments" was added
out of kindness by the old servant. The Marchesa
told Carlotta to go away, but not to put out
the light. "You will return when I ring," said
she.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when the bell sounded.</p>

<p>The maid hurried to her mistress.</p>

<p>"Is Don Franco still out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Signora Marchesa."</p>

<p>"Put out the light. Take your knitting and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
wait in the ante-room. When he returns come
and tell me."</p>

<p>Having given these orders, the Marchesa rolled
over on her side, turning her face towards the wall,
and leaving the amazed and ill-pleased maid to
stare at that white, smooth, impenetrable enigma,
her night-cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
THE GREAT STEP</h2>

<p>That same evening at exactly ten o'clock the
engineer Ribera knocked gently twice on
the door of Signor Giacomo Puttini's house at
Albogasio Superiore. Presently a window above
his head was opened, and a little, old, clean-shaven
face of "Sior Zacomo" himself appeared
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Most worshipful engineer, my respects!" said
he. "The servant is coming down to let you in."</p>

<p>"That is not necessary," the other answered.
"I am not coming up. It is time to start, so you
had better join me at once."</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo began to puff and wink hard.</p>

<p>"You must pardon me," he said, in his peculiar
dialect, which was a mixture of many elements.
"You must pardon me, most worshipful engineer,
but I really need&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Need what?" said the engineer, somewhat
annoyed. The door opened, and the keen and
yellow face of the servant appeared.</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Scior Parento!</i> Sir Relative!" said she
respectfully. She claimed I know not what
degree of relationship with the engineer's family,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and always addressed him thus. "At this hour?
Have you perhaps been to see the <i>Sciora Parenta</i>?
The Lady Relative?"</p>

<p>The "Lady Relative" was the engineer's sister,
Signora Rigey.</p>

<p>Ribera answered shortly: "Oh! Marianna!
How are you?" and went upstairs followed by
Marianna, carrying the light.</p>

<p>"My respects," Signor Giacomo began, coming
towards him with another light. "I understand
and recognise the great inconvenience I am
causing, but really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo's small, clean-shaven, pink
face, rose above an enormous white stock, and a
lean little body, buttoned up in a great, black overcoat,
and in the convulsive workings of his lips
and eyebrows as well as in his troubled eyes, the
most comical anxiety was expressed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter now?" asked the engineer,
somewhat sharply. He, the most upright and
straightforward man alive, had little sympathy
with the hesitation of poor, timid Signor Giacomo.</p>

<p>"Allow me," Puttini began, and, turning to
the servant, said harshly:</p>

<p>"Begone, you! Go into the kitchen. You will
come when I call for you. Go, I say! Why don't
you do what I tell you? Where is your respect
for me? I command here! I am the master!"</p>

<p>It was the servant's curiosity, her insolent
disregard for the orders of her superior, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
had provoked this outburst of despotic fury in
"Sior Zacomo."</p>

<p>"Whew! What a violent man!" she said,
lifting the lamp on high. "There is no need to
shout in that way! What do you think of it,
<i>Scior Parento</i>?"</p>

<p>"Look here!" the engineer exclaimed. "Would
it not be better for you to take yourself off,
instead of standing there and jabbering?"</p>

<p>Marianna went away grumbling, and Signor
Giacomo began to communicate his most secret
thoughts to the worshipful engineer, interlarding
his sentences with many <i>buts</i> and <i>ifs</i>, <i>that is</i> and
<i>reallys</i>. He had promised to be present in the
capacity of witness at Luisa's secret marriage, but
now, when it was time to start for Castello, he
was assailed by an overpowering fear of compromising
himself.</p>

<p>He was "first political deputy," as the highest
communal authority was then called. If the
worshipful Imperial and Royal Commissary of
Porlezza should get wind of this affair, how would
he look upon it? And the Marchesa? "A terrible
woman, most worthy engineer! A vindictive
woman!" Besides he had so many other worries!
"There is that cursed bull!" This bull, a bone of
contention between the town and the <i>alpador</i>,
or tenant of the hill-pastures, had, for the last
two years, been a moral incubus to poor Signor
Giacomo, who, in speaking of his troubles and
trials, always began with "that perfidious servant,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and ended with "that cursed bull!" In
speaking these words he would raise his small
face, his eyes full of pained execration, and
stretch out accusing hands towards the brow of
the hill which overhung his house, towards the
home of that fiendish beast. But the engineer,
whose fine, honest features betrayed marked
disapproval and a growing contempt for this
cowardly little man, who stood wriggling there
before him, exclaimed several times impatiently:
"Oh, dear me!" as if pitying himself for the poor
company he was in. Finally, his patience entirely
exhausted, he extended his arms with the
elbows turned outwards, and shaking them as if
he were holding the reins of a lazy old horse,
exclaimed: "What is all this? What is all this?
It is absurd! This is the language of a fool, my
good Signor Giacomo! I would never have
believed that a man like you, a man let us say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the engineer, being really at a loss for a
suitable phrase wherewith to describe his companion,
simply puffed out his cheeks, emitting
a long-drawn-out rumble, a sort of rattling noise,
as if he had an epithet in his mouth which was so
big that he could not spit it out. Meanwhile
Signor Giacomo, who had turned very red, was
protesting eagerly: "Enough! Enough! Pray
excuse me! I am quite ready! I will come! Don't
get excited! I only expressed a doubt, most
worshipful engineer. You know the world. So
did I, at one time, but I know it no longer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
    He withdrew for a moment to reappear again
presently carrying an enormously high hat with
a broad brim, which had seen Ferdinand enter
Verona in 1838, the so-called "emperor's year."</p>

<p>"I feel this sign of respect and satisfaction is
fitting," said he.</p>

<p>When the engineer caught sight of the thing,
he once more ejaculated his "What is all this?"
But the little man, who had a ceremonious spirit,
stuck to his point. "It is my duty, my duty!"
and he called to Marianna to light them down stairs.
When the servant saw her master with that immense
"sign of satisfaction" on his head, she gave
voice to her astonishment. "Hold your tongue!"
puffed the unfortunate Signor Giacomo. "Be
quiet!" and as soon as he was out of the door his
wrath burst forth. "There is no doubt about it,
that cursed servant will be the death of me!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you send her away, then?" the
engineer enquired.</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo had already placed one foot
on the first step of the narrow lane that leads
upwards on one side of the Puttini house, when
he was brought to a stand-still by this pointed
question, which pierced his conscience like a
dagger.</p>

<p>"Alas!" he replied, sighing.</p>

<p>"I understand," said the engineer.</p>

<p>"Besides, what good would that do?" the other
went on, after a short pause. "This is the same
as that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
    This old Venetian saying concerning the unfortunate
identity of the two relative pronouns,
Signor Giacomo pronounced as an epilogue, and
then, puffing loudly, emitted a loud breath, and
once more started forward.</p>

<p>Puttini leading and the engineer following,
they climbed steadily for a few minutes, up the
steep and narrow path, dimly lighted by the moon
which was hidden among the clouds. No sound
was heard save their slow steps, the thumping
of their sticks on the stones, and Signor Giacomo's
regular puffing: "Apff! Apff!" At the foot of the
narrow stairway leading to Pianca, the little man
stopped, removed his hat, wiped away the perspiration
with a big, white handkerchief, and glancing
up at the great walnut-tree, and the stables of
Pianca to which he must ascend, puffed harder
than ever.</p>

<p>"By the body of the rogue Bacchus!" he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>The engineer encouraged him. "Up with
you, Signor Giacomo. It is all for love of
Luisina."<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Signor Giacomo started on again without a
word, and when they reached the stables, beyond
which the path becomes less rough, he seemed
to forget the stairs, his scruples, the perfidious
servant, the Imperial and Royal Commissary, the
vindictive Marchesa and the cursed bull, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
began talking of Signora Rigey with great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about it, when I have the
honour of being in the company of your niece,
of Signorina Luisina, I assure you I really feel
as if I were back into the days of Signora Baratela
and the Filipuzze girls, of the three Sparesi sisters
from San Piero Incarian, and of many others,
whose graces used to charm me, in the old days.
From time to time I go to see the Marchesa, and
I sometimes meet the girls of to-day there. No&mdash;no&mdash;no,
they do not behave in a becoming manner.
They are either sullenly silent or over-talkative.
But just look at Signorina Luisina, how easy is
her manner with every one! She knows how to
behave with young and old, rich and poor, the
servant and the priest. I really fail to comprehend
why the Marchesa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The engineer interrupted him.</p>

<p>"The Marchesa is right," said he. "My niece
is neither of noble birth, nor has she a penny.
How can you expect the Marchesa to be satisfied?"</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo stopped short, rather disconcerted,
and stared at the engineer, blinking his
sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p>"How is this? You don't really mean to say
she is right?"</p>

<p>"I never approve of acting contrary to the
wishes of parents, or of those who represent the
parents. But I, dear Signor Giacomo, am an
old-fashioned man like yourself, a man of the time
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of Carlo Umberto, as they say hereabouts. Now,
the world wags differently, and we must let it
wag. Therefore, having expressed my opinions
on this point, I said to my relatives: 'Now do
as you like. But when you have decided one way
or another, let me know what is to be done, and
I shall be ready!'"</p>

<p>"And what does Signora Teresina say?"</p>

<p>"My sister? My sister, poor creature, says:
'If I can see them settled in life, I shall no longer
dread death.'"</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo breathed hard, as was his
habit whenever he heard that last, unpleasant
word pronounced.</p>

<p>"But it is surely not so bad as that?" said he.</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" the engineer replied, very
seriously. "We must trust in the Almighty."</p>

<p>They had reached a sharp bend where the narrow
path, passing the last of the small fields
belonging to the territory of Albogasio, turns
towards the first of those belonging to Castello,
and winds on, on the left, along the top of a jutting
crag, suddenly coming in sight of a deep cleft in
the mountain's bosom, of the lake far below, of
the villages of Casarico and San Mamette, crouching
on the shore as if in the act of drinking.
Castello is perched a little higher up, and not far
distant, facing the bare and forbidding peak of
Cressogno, the whole of which is visible, from
the gorges of Loggio to the sky. It is a beautiful
spot even at night in the moonlight, but if Signor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Giacomo paused there, striking a contemplative
attitude and forgetting to puff, it was not because
he considered the scene worthy of any one's
attention, to say nothing of that of a political
deputy, but because, having a weighty argument
to expound, he felt the necessity of concentrating
all his strength in his brain, and of suspending
all other effort, even that of the legs.</p>

<p>"That is a fine maxim," said he. "Let us trust
in the Almighty. Yes, my dear sir. But permit
me to observe that in our time we were always
hearing of prayers being answered, of conversions
and miracles. Am I not correct? But now the
world is not the same, and it appears to me the
Almighty is sick of it all. The world is in much
the same condition as our parish church at Albogasio,
which the Almighty used to visit once a
month. Now He comes only once a year."</p>

<p>"Listen, my good Signor Giacomo," said the
engineer, who was impatient to reach Castello.
"The Almighty is not to blame because the parish
has been transferred from one church to another.
However, we will push on, and let the Almighty
arrange things as He thinks best."</p>

<p>Whereupon he started forwarded so briskly
that presently Signor Giacomo was obliged to stop
again, puffing like a pair of bellows.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said he, "if I yield, in a measure,
to that curiosity which is inborn in man. Might
one inquire your worshipful age?"</p>

<p>The engineer understood the hidden meaning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of his question, and answered in a low tone, with
triumphant and ironical meekness&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am older than you!"</p>

<p>And he started off again at the same cruel pace.</p>

<p>"I was born in '88, you know," Puttini groaned.</p>

<p>"And I, in '85!" Ribera flung over his shoulder,
without stopping. "Now come along."</p>

<p>Fortunately for Puttini they had only a few
steps more to go. There was the great wall that
supported the consecrated ground about the
church of Castello, and there was the narrow
stairway leading up to the entrance of the village.
Now they must turn into the dark passage below
the priest's house, feeling their way along like
blind men through this black hole, in which Signor
Giacomo's imagination pictured so many treacherous
and slippery stones, so many accursed, deceitful
steps, that he stopped short, and, resting his
clasped hands on the knob of his stick, spoke
as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the body of the rogue Bacchus! No,
most worshipful engineer, no, no, no! Really
I cannot. I shall remain here. They will surely
come to church. The church is near by. I shall
wait here. Body of the rogue Bacchus!"</p>

<p>This last "Body!" Signor Giacomo ground
privately between his teeth, like the close of an
inward soliloquy concerning the accessories surrounding
the exceeding discomfort he was undergoing.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the engineer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
    A thread of light appeared under the church
door. The engineer entered and presently came
out again, accompanied by the sacristan, who had
been preparing the hassocks for the bride and
groom. He now brought to Puttini's rescue the
long pole with a lighted taper at the end, which
was used to light the candles on the altars. Thus,
standing in the church door, he moved the taper
along in front of Signor Giacomo's feet as far as
the pole would reach, while that gentleman, but
ill-satisfied with this religious illumination, groped
his way forward, grumbling at the darkness, the
miserable, sacred taper, and at him who held it,
until at last, abandoned by the sacristan, and
seized by the engineer, he was dragged along, much
like a pike at the end of a line, and, in spite of his
mute resistance, was finally landed on the threshold
of Casa Rigey.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At Castello the houses which stand in unbroken
line on the winding hill-top, enjoying the sun and
the view of the lake far below, all white and
smiling on the side towards the open, all dark on
the side towards that other row of less fortunate
houses, which rise sadly behind them, resemble
certain favoured individuals, who, brought into
too close contact with misery, assume a hostile
demeanour, and press close to one another that,
thus united, they may hold the others in check.
Among these fortunate ones Casa Rigey is one of
the darkest on the side facing the poverty of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
common houses, one of the brightest on the side
facing the sun.</p>

<p>From the street door a long and narrow corridor
leads to a small, open loggia, from which,
by means of a few steps, one may descend to the
little white terrace which, between the reception
room and a high, windowless wall, stretches out
to the edge of the hill, looking down into the
ravines from which issues the Soldo, looking down
upon the lake, as far as the green gulfs of the
Birosin and of the Doi, as far as the quiet sweeps
beyond Caprino and Gandria.</p>

<p>Signor Rigey, born in Milan of a French father,
had been professor of the French language at
Madame Berra's boarding school, but he had lost
his position there, and most of his private pupils,
because it was rumoured of him that he was irreligious.
In 1825 he had purchased this little
house, and retired to it from Milan, wishing to
live economically and peacefully. He had, soon
afterwards, married the sister of the civil-engineer
Ribera. Dying in 1844 he left his wife
with a daughter of fifteen, the house and a few
thousand <i>svanziche</i>.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Hardly had the engineer knocked somewhat
noisily at the door, when light, swift steps were
heard in the corridor. The door was thrown open
and a voice neither low nor silvery, but indescribably
harmonious, whispered: "What a noise,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Uncle!" "Noise indeed!" her uncle replied with
mock dignity. "Am I then expected to knock
with my nose?" His niece placed one hand over
his mouth, and with the other drew him inside; then
she saluted Signor Giacomo gracefully, and closed
the door. All this was accomplished in the twinkling
of an eye, while Signor Giacomo himself was
puffing out: "Your most humble servant! I am
really delightful&mdash;&mdash;" "Thank you, thank you!"
said Luisa. "Pray go in, I have a word to say
to Uncle."</p>

<p>The little man went forward, hat in hand, and
the young girl tenderly embraced her old uncle,
kissing him, pressing her face to his breast, and
clasping her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Won't that do now?" said the engineer, almost
as if to check these caresses, for in them he
felt a gratitude which he feared would presently
take the form of words. "There, there! That
is enough! How is Mamma?" Luisa's only
reply was a tightening of her embrace. This
uncle was more than a father to her, he was the
special Providence of the house, but, in his great
and simple bounty, he never dreamed that he had
the slightest claim to the gratitude of his sister
and niece. Whatever would these poor women
have done without him, possessing only that
meagre sum of twelve or fifteen thousand <i>svanziche</i>
which Rigey had left? As civil-engineer,
employed on public works, Ribera enjoyed a good
salary. He lived frugally at Como with an old
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
housekeeper, passing his savings on to Casa
Rigey. At first he had openly and heartily disapproved
of Luisa's attachment for Franco, for
it seemed to him that such a union would be
but ill-assorted; but the young people being
determined, and his sister having consented,
he made up his mind to help them in every possible
way, keeping his opinions to himself.</p>

<p>"And Mamma?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"She was feeling very well this evening because
she was so happy, but now she is agitated, for
Franco came about half an hour ago, and told
her he has had something of a scene with his
grandmother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh dear me!" the engineer exclaimed. Whenever
he heard of a misfortune befalling any one
else he always uttered this expression of self-commiseration.</p>

<p>"No, Uncle! Indeed Franco is right!"</p>

<p>Luisa pronounced these words with sudden
warmth. "Yes indeed!" she exclaimed, her
uncle having uttered a doubtful "Hm!" "He
is perfectly right. But," she added in a low tone,
"he says he left home in such a manner that his
grandmother will probably discover everything."</p>

<p>"It will be better so," said her uncle, starting
towards the terrace.</p>

<p>The moon had set and it was dark. Luisa
whispered: "Mamma is here."</p>

<p>Signora Teresa, who was suffering for want of
breath, had had herself drawn out into the terrace
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in her easy-chair, hoping to find relief in the
open air.</p>

<p>"What do you say to this, Piero?" said a voice
resembling Luisa's in tone, but sweeter and with
a tired ring; a voice that seemed to come from a
gentle heart which the world has used harshly,
and which must yield. "What do you say to
this? After all, our precautions will be of no
avail."</p>

<p>"No, no, Mamma. We are not sure of that.
We cannot say so yet!"</p>

<p>While Luisa was speaking, Franco, who was in
the salon with the curate, came out to embrace
the engineer.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ribera, extending his hand, for
embraces were little to his taste. "What has
happened?"</p>

<p>Franco related what had taken place, softening
somewhat certain too offensive expressions of
his grandmother's concerning the Rigeys, concealing
her threat of not leaving him a penny,
and blaming his own over-susceptibility rather
than the old-woman's ill-nature, and finally confessing
that he had purposely let it be known that
he intended to remain out all night. This could
have no other effect than that of leading his
grandmother to an immediate discovery, for she
would question him concerning this absence, and
his silence would be a confession, for he did not
intend to lie about this matter.</p>

<p>"Listen!" Uncle Piero exclaimed, with the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ringing voice and open countenance of the perfectly
straightforward man who, being smothered
to the point of suffocation with precautions and
dissimulations, finally strikes out from the shoulder
and, casting them off, breathes freely once more.
"I admit you were wrong to irritate your grandmother,
for, after all, old people must be respected
even when they err; I see that the consequences
may be serious, but nevertheless I am glad things
are as they are, and I should be more glad if you
had told your grandmother everything, clearly
and roundly. I have never had any patience with
all this secrecy, all this feigning and hiding. The
honest man openly confesses his actions. You
desire to marry against your grandmother's
wishes? Well do so, but, at least, don't deceive
her."</p>

<p>"But Piero!" Signora Teresa exclaimed, who,
besides a delicate perception of what life should
be, possessed an accurate sense of what life really
is, and, being much more given to religious exercises
than her brother, and standing on a more
familiar footing with the Almighty, could most
easily persuade herself that He would make certain
concessions in the matter of form, when some
substantial benefit was to be gained.</p>

<p>"But Piero! You don't think! If the Marchesa
finds out about the marriage this way, she
will, of course, refuse to receive Luisa into her
house, and then what are the children to do?
Where can they go? There is no room here, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
even if there were, nothing is ready. At your
house it is the same. You must consider all these
points. If we wished to keep the marriage a
secret for a month or two, it was not in order to
deceive, it was to gain time in which to win over
Franco's grandmother, and if she would not yield,
to prepare one or two rooms at Oria."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" said the engineer, "Does it
take two months to do that? It seems incredible!"</p>

<p>At this point a prolonged puff in the shadow
reminded them of Signor Giacomo's presence; he
was leaning against the wall in one corner not
daring to move, because it was so dark.</p>

<p>Signora Teresa had not yet welcomed him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Signor Giacomo!" she now hastened to
say. "I beg your pardon. I am really so very,
very much obliged to you! Pray come this way.
Did you hear what we were saying? Do let us
have your opinion."</p>

<p>"Your very humble servant," said Signor
Giacomo from his corner. "Really I dare not
move, for with my poor sight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luisa!" Signora Teresa called. "Bring a
lamp. But did you hear, Signor Giacomo? What
do you think about it? Do tell us."</p>

<p>In his profound wisdom Signor Giacomo emitted
three or four little hasty puffs which meant: Ah,
this is indeed an embarrassing question!</p>

<p>"I cannot say," he began hesitatingly, "I
cannot say at present, being in the dark&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Luisa!" Signora Teresa called once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
    "No, no, Signora! I mean being in the dark
on so many points. I feel that in my ignorance
I may not pronounce an opinion. Still I will say
it seems to me that perhaps it might ... well,
at any rate, I am here at your service and at the
service of this most respected family, though
indeed I should not be astonished if the Imperial
and Royal Commissary&mdash;a most excellent person,
but very punctilious.... But enough, we will
not talk of that, for here I am. But I do say, it
seems to me that we might wait a little while,
and our most noble friend Don Franco here might
be able to wheedle and persuade.... Well, well,
well. Do as you like. It is all the same to me."</p>

<p>A furious protest on Franco's part had caused
Signor Giuseppe to face about thus suddenly.
Luisa seconded this protest, and Signora Teresa,
who now would perhaps have been in favour of
a postponement, did not venture to oppose their
wishes.</p>

<p>"Luisa, Franco," said she, "take me back to
the salon."</p>

<p>The two young people pushed the easy-chair
into the salon, followed by Uncle Piero and Signor
Giacomo.</p>

<p>On the threshold Luisa, bending over her
mother, kissed her hair, and murmured: "You
will see. All will be for the best."</p>

<p>She had expected to find the curate in the salon,
but he had slipped away through the kitchen.</p>

<p>Hardly had Franco and Luisa pushed the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
invalid's chair up to the table upon which stood
the lamp, when the sacristan came to say that
everything was ready. Signora Teresa asked him
to inform the curate that the bride and groom
would go to church in half an hour.</p>

<p>"Luisa!" said she, glancing meaningly at her
daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma," the girl replied, and turning
to her lover, said in a low tone: "Franco, Mamma
wishes to speak with you."</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo understood, and went out to the
terrace. The engineer did not understand at all,
and his niece had to explain to him that her
mother was to be left alone with Franco. The
simple-minded man could see no reason for this,
but she took his arm and, smiling, led him away
to the terrace.</p>

<p>Signora Teresa silently held out her beautiful
hand, which was still youthful in its curves, and
Franco, kneeling, kissed it.</p>

<p>"Poor Franco," said she gently.</p>

<p>Then she made him rise from his knees and sit
close to her. She must speak to him, she said,
and her breath was so short. But he would
understand much from a few words, would
he not?</p>

<p>In speaking these words her voice was infinitely
sweet.</p>

<p>"You must know," she began, "that I had not
intended to say this to you, but I thought of it
when you spoke about breaking the plate at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
dinner-table. I beg you to be careful on account
of Uncle Piero's position. In his heart he feels
as you do. If you only could have seen the letters
he wrote me in 1848! But he is a servant of the
Government. It is true his conscience is perfectly
easy, for he knows that by engineering roads and
water-works he is serving his country and not the
Germans. But he must and will take certain
precautions, and you&mdash;for love of him&mdash;must
be cautious also."</p>

<p>"The Germans will soon be gone, Mamma!"
Franco replied. "But do not worry; you shall
see how prudent I will be."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! I have little more to see, I
have only to see you two united and blessed
by the Lord. When the Germans go, you will
come to Looch to tell me of it."</p>

<p>Those small fields where the little cemetery
of Castello is situated go by the name of Looch.</p>

<p>"But I had intended to speak to you of another
matter," Signora Teresa went on, without giving
Franco time to protest. He took her hands and
pressed them, with difficulty restraining his
tears.</p>

<p>"I must speak to you of Luisa," she said. "You
must know your wife well."</p>

<p>"I do know her, Mamma! I know her as well
as you do, and perhaps even better."</p>

<p>As he pronounced these words his whole being
glowed and quivered in his passionate love for her
who was the life of his life, the soul of his soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
    "Poor Franco!" said Signora Teresa, smiling
tenderly. "No, listen to me, for there is something
you do not know, of which you should be
informed. Wait a moment."</p>

<p>She needed to rest. Her emotion made her
breathing more laboured, and she spoke with
greater difficulty than usual. She motioned to
Franco not to move, for she saw he was about to
rise, that he might do something to relieve her.
Only a little repose was necessary, and she took
it, resting her head against the chair-back.</p>

<p>Presently she roused herself. "You have probably
heard many evil accounts of my poor husband,
at your own home. You will have heard
that he was an unprincipled man, and that I did
very wrong to marry him. It is true he was not
religious, and for that reason I hesitated some time
before deciding to accept him. I was advised
to do so because it was thought I might have a
good influence over this man, who had a most
noble soul. He died a Christian, and I have every
hope of meeting him in Heaven, if the Lord, in
His mercy, shall see fit to receive me there. But
up to the very last hour it seemed as if I were not
to accomplish anything. Now, I fear my Luisa
has her father's tendencies in her heart. She
hides them from me, but I feel they are there. I
commend her to you; study her, advise her; she
is gifted and has a great heart, and if I have not
known how to do well by her, you must do better.
You are a good Christian: see that, with all her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
heart, she also becomes one. Promise me this,
Franco."</p>

<p>He promised, smiling, as if he considered her
fears groundless, and were making this superfluous
promise simply to satisfy her.</p>

<p>The invalid gazed sadly at him. "Believe me,"
she added, "these are not fancies. I cannot die
in peace if you do not take this matter seriously."
And when the young man had repeated his promise,
this time without smiling, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"One word more. When you leave here you
will go to Professor Gilardoni's, will you not?"</p>

<p>"That was my first plan. I was to have told
my grandmother that I was going to sleep at
Gilardoni's house, as we were to start on an excursion
together in the morning. But now, you
know how I left home."</p>

<p>"Still you had better go there. I had rather
you went there, and besides, he expects you,
does he not? So you must go. Poor Gilardoni!
He has never been here since his fit of madness,
two years ago. You know about that, do you
not? Luisa has told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma."</p>

<p>This Professor Gilardoni, who lived like a hermit
at Casarico, had fallen most romantically
in love with Signora Teresa some years before,
and had timidly presented himself to her as a
suitor. She had received his proposal with such
utter amazement that he had lacked courage to
appear before her again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
    "Poor man!" Signora Rigey continued, "that
was a most stupid action, but he has a heart of
gold, and is a true friend. I wish you to cherish
him. The day before he had that mad fit, he
confided a secret to me. I may not repeat to you
what he said, and moreover, I beg you not to
mention the subject to him unless he speaks to
you about it; but it is, in fact, something which,
under certain circumstances, might be of great
importance to you two, especially if you have
children. If Gilardoni should confide in you,
reflect seriously before telling Luisa. She might
look at the matter in a wrong light. Consider
the question carefully, consult Uncle Piero, and
then speak or remain silent according to the line
of action you may have determined to adopt."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mamma."</p>

<p>There was a gentle tap at the door, and Luisa's
voice said: "Have you finished?"</p>

<p>Franco looked at the invalid. "Come in,"
said she. "Is it time to go?"</p>

<p>Luisa did not answer, but threw one arm around
Franco's neck, and together they knelt before the
mother, their heads buried in her lap. Luisa
tried her best to restrain her tears, knowing well
that her mother should be spared all violent
emotion, but her heaving shoulders betrayed her.</p>

<p>"No, Luisa, no, dear, no!" said her mother,
caressing her bowed head. "I am grateful to
you, for you have always been a good daughter
dear; such a good daughter! Calm yourself; I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
am so happy! You will see, I shall get better.
Now go. Kiss me, both of you, and then go.
You must not keep the curate waiting. May
God bless you, Luisa, and you also, Franco!"</p>

<p>She asked for her prayer-book, drew the lamp
towards her, had the windows and the door leading
to the terrace thrown open that she might breathe
more easily, and then dismissed the maid, who
was prepared to keep her company. When the
young couple had left the room, the engineer
came in to greet his sister before going to
church.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Teresa."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Piero. Another load is laid on your
shoulders, my poor Piero."</p>

<p>"Amen!" the engineer answered, calmly.</p>

<p>When she was alone Signora Rigey sat listening
to the receding footsteps. The heavy steps of her
brother and Signor Giacomo bringing up the
rear, prevented her hearing those others, which
she strained her ear to follow as far as possible.</p>

<p>Another moment and the sounds ceased. She
realised that Luisa and Franco were going away
together into the future, whither she might follow
them only for a few months, perhaps only for a
few days; that she could neither divine nor foresee
what their fate would be. "Poor children!"
she thought. "Who knows what they may have
passed through in five years, in ten years." She
listened again, but the silence was profound; the
open window admitted only the far-away thundering
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of the cascades of Rescia, over across the lake.
Then, thinking that they must already have entered
the church, she took her prayer-book, and
read attentively.</p>

<p>But she soon grew weary; her brain was confused,
and the words of the book blurred before
her eyes.</p>

<p>Her mind was becoming drowsy, her will-power
was lost. She foresaw the approach of a vision
of unreal things, but she knew she was not asleep,
she understood that this was not a dream, but
a condition produced by her malady. She saw
the door leading to the kitchen open, and there
entered old Gilardoni from Dasio, called "el
Carlin de Das," father of the Professor and agent
of the Maironi family, for the estates in Valsolda&mdash;he
had been dead five-and-twenty years. The
figure came forward, and said, in a natural voice:
"Oh, Signora Teresa! Are you quite well?"
She thought she answered&mdash;"Oh, Carlin! I am
quite well; and how are you?" But in reality
she did not speak.</p>

<p>"I've got the letter here," the figure continued,
waving a letter triumphantly. "I've brought it
here for you!" And he placed the letter on the
table.</p>

<p>Signora Teresa saw it quite plainly. A letter,
soiled and yellowed by time, without an envelope,
and still bearing traces of a little red wafer, lay
before her and she experienced a sense of lively
satisfaction. She thought she said: "Thank you,
Carlin. Are you going to Dasio, now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
    "No, Signora," Carlin replied. "I am going to
Casarico to see my son."</p>

<p>The invalid could no longer distinguish Carlin, but
she saw the letter on the table, saw it distinctly.
Still she was not sure it was there; in her sluggish
brain the vague memory of other past hallucinations
still endured, the memory of the disease,
which was her enemy, her cruel master. Her eyes
were glassy, her breathing laboured and rapid.</p>

<p>The sound of hastening footsteps roused her,
and recalled her almost completely to herself.
When Luisa and Franco came swiftly into the
room from the terrace they did not notice that
their mother's face was distorted, for the lamp
was heavily shaded. Kneeling before her they
covered her with kisses, attributing that laboured
breathing to emotion. Suddenly the invalid
raised her head from the chair-back and stretched
out her hands, pointing to something at which
she was looking fixedly.</p>

<p>"The letter!" she said.</p>

<p>The young people turned, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>"What letter, Mamma?" Luisa asked. At
the same moment she noticed her mother's expression,
and warned Franco by a glance. This was
not the first time that Signora Teresa had suffered
from hallucinations since her illness began. At
the question, "What letter?" everything became
clear to her. "Oh!" she exclaimed, and withdrawing
her hands, buried her face in them,
weeping silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
    Comforted by her children's caresses she soon
composed herself, kissed them, extended her hand
to her brother and Signor Giacomo, who did not
in the least understand what had happened, and
then motioned to Luisa to go and get something.
It was a question of a cake and a precious bottle
of wine from Niscioree, which, together with some
others, had been sent some time before by the
Marchese Bianchi, to whom Signora Teresa was an
object of special veneration.</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo, who was longing to be off,
began to fidget and puff, and glance towards the
engineer.</p>

<p>"Signora Luisina," said he, seeing the bride
about to leave the room. "Pray excuse me, but
I was just going to take leave of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Signora Rigey exclaimed, with only
a thread of voice. "Wait a little longer."</p>

<p>Luisa disappeared, and Franco slipped out of
the room behind his wife. Signora Teresa was
suddenly assailed by scruples, and signed to her
brother to call him back.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the engineer.</p>

<p>"But Piero!"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>The ancient and austere traditions of her house,
a delicate sense of dignity, perhaps also a religious
scruple, because the young couple had not yet
received the benediction of the nuptial Mass,
would neither allow Signora Teresa to approve
of their withdrawing together, nor to explain her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
views on the subject. Her reticence and Uncle
Piero's fatherly benevolence gave Franco time to
place himself beyond the possibility of recall.
Signora Teresa did not insist.</p>

<p>"Forever!" she murmured presently, as if
speaking to herself. "United forever!"</p>

<p>"You and I," said the engineer, addressing his
colleague in celibacy in the Venetian dialect,
"you and I, Signor Giacomo, never go in for any
such nonsense!"</p>

<p>"You are always in good spirits, most worshipful
engineer!" Signor Giacomo answered, while his
conscience was telling him that in his time he
had gone in for far worse "nonsense."</p>

<p>The bride and groom did not return.</p>

<p>"Signor Giacomo," the engineer continued,
"there will be no going to bed for us to-night."</p>

<p>The unfortunate man writhed, puffed and
winked hard but did not reply.</p>

<p>Still the bride and groom were absent.</p>

<p>"Piero," said Signora Teresa, "ring the bell."</p>

<p>"Signor Giacomo," the engineer began, composedly,
"shall we ring the bell?"</p>

<p>"That would seem to be the Signora's wish,"
the little man replied, steering his course as best
he could between the brother and sister. "However,
I express no opinion."</p>

<p>"Piero!" his sister pleaded.</p>

<p>"Come, let us have an answer," Uncle Piero
continued without moving. "What would you do?
Would you, or would you not ring this bell?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
    "For pity's sake!" Signor Giacomo groaned.
"You really must excuse me."</p>

<p>"I will excuse nothing!"</p>

<p>The young people were still absent, and the
mother growing more and more anxious,
repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>"Piero, I tell you to ring!"</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo, who was dying to get away,
and who could not leave without saluting the
bride and groom, encouraged by Signora Teresa's
insistence, made a great effort, turned very red
and finally pronounced an opinion: "I should
ring."</p>

<p>"My dear Signor Giacomo," the engineer exclaimed,
"I am surprised, amazed and astonished!"
Who can say why, when he was in good
spirits, and had occasion to use one of these
synonyms, he would always string the three together?
"However," he concluded, "let us ring."</p>

<p>And he proceeded to ring very gently.</p>

<p>"Listen, Piero," said Signora Teresa. "Remember
that when you leave, Franco is to go
with you. He will return at half-past five for
the Mass."</p>

<p>"Oh dear me!" Uncle Piero exclaimed. "How
many difficulties! But after all, are they or are
they not husband and wife?&mdash;Well, well," he
added, seeing that his sister was beginning to
grow excited, "do just as you like!"</p>

<p>Instead of the young couple the maid appeared,
bringing the cake and the bottle, and told the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
engineer that Signorina Luisina begged him to
come out to the terrace for a moment.</p>

<p>"Now that something good is coming at last,
you send me outside!" said the engineer. He
jested with his usual serenity of spirit, perhaps
because he did not fully realize his sister's serious
condition, perhaps because of his naturally pacific
attitude towards all that was inevitable.</p>

<p>He went out to the terrace where Luisa and
Franco were waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Listen, Uncle," his niece began. "My husband
says that his grandmother will surely discover
everything at once; that he will not be able
to remain at Cressogno any longer; that if Mamma
were stronger we might all go to your house at
Oria, but, unfortunately, that is not possible as
matters stand at present. So he thinks we might
arrange a room here&mdash;any way to get it ready
quickly. We had thought of poor Papa's study.
What do you say to this plan?"</p>

<p>"Hm!" ejaculated Uncle Piero, who was slow
to take up with new ideas. "It seems to me a
very hasty resolution. You will be incurring
expense and turning the house upside down, for
an arrangement which can only be temporary."</p>

<p>His one idea was to have the whole family at
Oria, and this expedient did not suit him. He
feared that if the young people once settled down
at Castello they would remain there. Luisa used
every argument to persuade him that there was
no other way, and that neither the outlay nor the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
trouble would be great. On leaving home her
husband would go directly to Lugano, and bring
back what few pieces of furniture were absolutely
indispensable. Uncle Piero asked if Franco could
not take up his quarters at Oria, remaining there
until such a time as she and her mother could join
him. "Oh, Uncle!" Luisa exclaimed. Had she
known about the bell she would have been still
more astonished by a similar proposal. But
sometimes this good man had artless ideas of this
sort, at which his sister smiled. Luisa had no
difficulty in finding arguments against his plan
for banishing Franco, and she used them with
warmth. "Enough!" said Uncle Piero calmly,
though he was not convinced; and he arched his
wide-spread arms with the gesture of the <i>Dominus
vobiscum</i>, more charitably inclined, more ready
to enfold poor humanity in a tender embrace than
before. "<i>Fiat!</i> Oh, by the way," he added,
turning to Franco, "how about money?"</p>

<p>Franco shivered, much embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You know he is our father!" his wife said.</p>

<p>"Not by any means your father," Uncle Piero
observed placidly. "Not by any means, but what
is mine is yours; so I shall line your pockets as
well as my means will permit."</p>

<p>And he suffered, without returning it, the embrace
which told of their gratitude, almost as if
vexed by this unnecessary demonstration, vexed
that they should not accept more simply an act
which to him seemed so simple and natural. "Yes,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
yes!" said he, "now let us go in and drink; it will
be far more profitable!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The wine of Niscioree, clear and red as a ruby,
at once delicate and strong, flattered and soothed
the inner-man of the impatient Signor Giacomo,
who, in those years of <i>oidium</i>, seldom wet his lips
in undiluted wine, but gloomily sipped the Grimelli
wine, of watery memory.</p>

<p>"<i>Est</i>, <i>est</i>,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> is it not, Signor Giacomo?" said
Uncle Piero, seeing Puttini gaze with devoted
eyes into the glass he held. "But here at least,
there is no danger of expiring like a certain man:
<i>et propter nimium est dominus meus mortuus est</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
    "I feel as if I were being resuscitated," Signor
Giacomo answered, speaking very slowly and almost
under his breath, his gaze still fixed on the
glass.</p>

<p>"Then you must give us a toast," the other
said, rising. "But if you will not speak, why then
I must do so," and he recited merrily&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Long live he and long live she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now we'll be off, and leave them free!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Signor Giacomo emptied his glass, puffed
loudly and winked hard, in consequence of the
varied sentiments which were running riot in his
soul, while the last perfume, the last flavour of the
wine were fading in his mouth. He offered his
duty to the "most revered" Signora Teresa, his
devotion to the "most amiable" little bride, his
respects to the "most accomplished" young husband.
Then, gesticulating with head and arms,
he declared himself undeserving of the thanks
which were being lavished upon him, and taking
his great hat and his stick, he started&mdash;humble
and puffing, with mingled feelings of relief and
regret&mdash;to follow the placid bulk of the "most
worshipful" engineer.</p>

<p>"And you, Franco?" Signora Teresa enquired
immediately.</p>

<p>"I am going," he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
    "Come here," said she. "I received you so
badly when you returned from church, my poor
children! You see I had had one of my bad attacks;
I think you understood. But now I feel so well,
so peaceful! Lord, I thank Thee! it seems to me
I have set my house in order, have put out the
fire and said my prayers; and now I am going to
sleep, so well satisfied! But not so very soon,
dear, not at once. I leave you my Luisa, dear;
I leave you Uncle Piero. I know you will love
them very much, will you not? But you must
remember me also. Ah, dear Lord! how sorry I
am I shall not see your children! That is indeed
a grief to me! You must give them a kiss every
day for their poor grandmother ... every day.
And now go, my son, but you will be back by
half-past five? Yes, dear.... Good-by ...
now go."</p>

<p>She spoke caressingly to him, as to a child who
does not yet understand, and he wept silently,
with tender emotion, kissing her hands over and
over again, and glad Luisa was present to witness
this scene, for in his immense tenderness for the
mother, there was his immense joy at being one
with the daughter, and an intense desire to love
all that his wife loved, and in the same measure.</p>

<p>"Go," Mamma Teresa repeated, fearing her own
increasing emotion. "Go, go!"</p>

<p>At last he obeyed and went out with Luisa.</p>

<p>On this occasion also Luisa was absent a long
time, but even the holiest souls have their little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
weaknesses, and although the maid was constantly
coming and going between the kitchen and the
salon, Signora Teresa, touched by the affection
which Franco had displayed for her, never once
ordered her to ring the bell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
CARLIN'S LETTER</h2>

<p>Franco went down the hill very, very
slowly, absorbed in the world of things
within him, so crowded with thoughts and with
new sensations. Stopping every now and then
to contemplate the grey road and the small dark
fields, he would touch the leaves of a grape-vine
or the stones of a low wall, in order to feel the
reality of the external world, to convince himself
that he was not dreaming. Not until he had
reached the Contrada dei Mal'ari in Casarico, and
was standing before the little door of Gilardoni's
tiny house, did he recall Mamma Teresa's dark
words concerning the secret Gilardoni had imparted
to her, and he wondered what this mystery
could be, which must not be revealed to Luisa.
To tell the truth the mother's advice had not
satisfied him entirely. "How could I ever hide
anything from my wife?" he thought as he knocked
at the door.</p>

<p>Professor Beniamino Gilardoni, son of "Carlin
de Dàas," had been educated at the expense of
old Don Franco Maironi, Marchesa Orsola's husband,
an eccentric man, capricious and violent,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
but at the same time, very generous. When
Carlin died it became apparent that Maironi's
generosity had not been necessary. Beniamino
inherited quite a little hoard, and this maddened
Don Franco, who held him responsible for the
paternal hypocrisy, turned his back upon him,
and would have nothing more to do with him for
the short time he survived his agent. The young
man chose the career of teacher, was professor
of Latin at the gymnasium of Cremona, and of
philosophy at the lyceum of Udine. Of a delicate
constitution, apprehensive of physical suffering,
and extremely misanthropical, he resigned his
professorship in 1842, and came to Valsolda to
enjoy the modest fortune his father had left him.
Dasio, his native village, perched just below the
dolomitic rocks of the Arabione, was too high up
and inconvenient for him. He sold his possessions
there, purchased the olive-grove of Sedorgg above
Casarico, and a small villa on the edge of the lake,
in Casarico itself. It was so small as to be almost
a toy villa, and from its shape he called it the
"Greek <i>II</i> or Pi" in imitation of the "Digamma"
of Ugo Foscolo. From the Contrada dei Mal'ari
a short passage led to the little courtyard flanked
by a tiny portico, open on the lake-side and surrounded
by tall oleanders. It overlooked six
miles of water, green, grey or blue, according to
the hour, as far as Monte S. Salvatore there in
the distance, stooping, under the burden of its
melancholy hump, towards the humble hills of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Carona beneath it. On the east of the little house
there was a kitchen-garden, fabulously large for
that part of the world, the dimensions of which
Engineer Ribera was wont to define by means of
the following surveyor's description: "Large
field called <i>il Campone</i>, measuring seven <i>tavole</i>."
Now seven <i>tavole</i> correspond to twenty or twenty-two
square metres! The Professor cultivated
it with the aid of his little servant Giuseppe,
called Pinella, and of a small collection of French
treatises. He sent to France for the seeds of the
most highly esteemed qualities of vegetables,
which sometimes came up in shameless disregard
of their certificates of baptism, and indeed of any
honestly baptised family. It would then happen
that philosopher and servant, stooping over the
beds, their hands on their knees, would raise their
eyes from these mocking sprouts, and gaze at each
other, the philosopher honestly disappointed, the
servant hypocritically so. In one corner of the
garden, in a little stable constructed according to
the most approved principles, dwelt a small Swiss
cow, which had been purchased after three months
of diligent study, and had turned out as delicate
and fleshless as the master himself, who&mdash;in spite
of the Swiss cow and four Paduan hens&mdash;often
found it impossible to make himself a cup of custard
in his own house. In the wall supporting the
garden on the lake-side, against whose base the
<i>breva</i> drove the swelling waves, he had made some
openings in which, following Franco Maironi's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
advice, he had planted many American aloes,
many roses and some caper-bushes, thus binding
together the substantial contents of his kitchen-garden,
as he was wont to say, with poetic elegance
of form. And for the love of the poetic,
he had left a small corner of his kitchen-garden
uncultivated. The tallest of reeds had sprung
up there, and in front of these reeds the Professor
had erected a sort of belvedere, a lofty, wooden
platform, very rustic and primitive, where, in
pleasant weather, he passed many happy hours
with the mystic books he loved, enjoying the coolness
of the <i>breva</i>, and the murmuring of reeds and
waves. At a distance the colour of the platform
could not be distinguished from that of the reeds,
and the Professor looked as if he were seated on
air, book in hand, like any magician. In the
little salon he kept the small collection of works
on kitchen-gardening, the mystic books, the
treatises on necromancy, and gnosticism. The
writings on hallucinations and dreams he kept
in a tiny study adjoining his bedroom, a sort of
ship's cabin, into which lake and sky seemed
to pour through the window.</p>

<p>After the death of old Maironi the Professor
had once more taken to visiting the family, but
the Marchesa did not please him particularly,
and her son Don Alessandro, Franco's father,
pleased him still less. So he ended by going there
only once a year. When the lad Franco entered
the lyceum his grandmother&mdash;his father had been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
dead some time&mdash;begged Gilardoni to give him
some lessons during the Autumn. Master and
pupil resembled each other in their easy enthusiasms,
in their fits of violent but fleeting passion,
and both were ardent patriots. When the necessity
for lessons no longer existed they continued
to meet as friends, though the Professor was some
twenty years older than Franco. Gilardoni admired
his pupil's genius, but Franco, on the other
hand, held the half-Christian, half-rationalist
philosophy of his master, and his mystical tendencies,
in small esteem. He laughed at the
other's passion for books and theories on horticulture
and landscape gardening, a passion which
was entirely devoid of all common sense. But nevertheless,
he loved him sincerely for his goodness,
his candour, his ardent soul. Franco had been
the Professor's confidant at the time of his unfortunate
passion for Signora Rigey, and later,
Franco, in his turn, confided in the Professor.
Gilardoni was much affected by the news, and
told Franco that, his heart being still full to overflowing
of that unchanging devotion, he should
feel as if he were, in a way, becoming Franco's
father, even though Signora Teresa herself would
have none of him. Franco showed little appreciation
of this metaphysical paternity. This
passion for Signora Rigey seemed to him simply
an aberration, and he was more than ever confirmed
in his opinion that the Professor's head was
not worth much, but that his heart was of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    So he knocked at the door, and Beniamino
himself came to open it, bearing a little oil lamp.
"Well done," said he. "I was beginning to think
you were not coming, after all."</p>

<p>Gilardoni was in his dressing-gown and slippers,
with a sort of white turban on his head, and he
exhaled a strong odour of camphor. He looked
like a Turk, like Gilardoni Bey, but the thin,
sallow face which smiled beneath the turban had
nothing Turkish about it. Encircled by a short,
reddish beard, pompously embellished in the
middle by a fine, big nose, red and pimply, the
face was lighted up by two beautiful blue eyes,
still very youthful, and full of simple kindness
and poetry.</p>

<p>As soon as Franco had closed the door behind
him his friend whispered: "Is it done?" "It is
done," Franco answered. The other embraced
him and kissed him in silence. Then he took
him up stairs to the little study. On the way he
explained that, <i>secundum</i> Raspail, he had applied
a compress of some sedative water to his head,
for he was threatened with a headache. He was
an apostle of Raspail, and had converted Franco&mdash;who
often suffered from inflammatory sore throats&mdash;from
leeches to camphor cigarettes.</p>

<p>In the little study there was another very close
and long embrace. "So much! So much! So
much!" Gilardoni exclaimed, meaning a world
of things.</p>

<p>Poor Gilardoni, his eyes were glistening. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
himself had longed in vain for a happiness similar
to his friend's! Franco understood and, much
embarrassed, did not know what to say to him,
and a silence so significant followed that Gilardoni
could not stand it, and set about lighting a little
fire to heat some coffee he had prepared. Franco
offered to do this for him, and the Professor
accepted, pleading his headache, and began unrolling
his turban before a basin of the sedative
water. "Well," said he, controlling his emotion
by an effort of his will, "tell me all about it."
Franco told him everything, from his grandmother's
dinner-party, to the wedding ceremony
in the church at Castello, except of course, his
private talk with Signora Teresa. Professor
Beniamino, meanwhile, had replaced his turban,
and now summoned up all his courage. "And&mdash;&mdash;"
said he, substituting a sort of low groan for
the beloved name, "how is she?" Upon learning
of the hallucination he exclaimed: "A letter?
She thought she saw a letter? But what letter?"
This Franco did not know. A hissing on the fire
interrupted the conversation; the coffee was
boiling hard and bubbling over.</p>

<p>Gilardoni also resembled his young friend in
that his heart might be read from his face. The
young friend who was, however, a far cleverer
and quicker reader of faces than he, at once perceived
that he had thought of some special letter,
and inquired, while the coffee was settling, if he
could explain this hallucination. The Professor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
hastened to say "no," but no sooner had he
uttered that "no" than he weakened it by adding
several other negatives, mingled with inarticulate
grumblings: "Ah, no!&mdash;no indeed!&mdash;I cannot
say&mdash;certainly not!" Franco did not insist,
and another extremely significant silence ensued.
When he had taken his coffee, with many involuntary
signs of uneasiness, the Professor promptly
proposed that they go to bed. Franco, who must
leave before daybreak, preferred not to go to bed,
but wished his friend to do so, and, after an infinite
number of protests and ceremonies, after hesitating
on the very threshold, his basin of sedative
water in his hand, the Professor suddenly faced
about, and throwing a "good-night" over his
shoulder, disappeared.</p>

<p>When he was alone Franco put out the lamp
and stretched himself in an easy-chair with the
good intention of going to sleep, seeking sleep in
some indifferent thought if he could possibly fix
his mind on such a thought. Not five minutes
had passed when there was a knock at the door
and immediately the Professor rushed in, without
a light, and exclaiming: "Well, here I am again!"
"What is the matter?" Franco inquired. "I am
sorry I put out the light." At the same moment
he felt the arms of the worthy Beniamino about
his neck, his beard brushed Franco's face, and
he smelt the camphor and heard the voice. "Dear,
dear, Don Franco! I have an enormous load on
my heart! I did not intend to speak now; I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
wanted to leave you in peace, but I cannot, I
cannot!"</p>

<p>"But speak! Calm yourself, calm yourself!"
said Franco, gently freeing himself from that
embrace.</p>

<p>Gilardoni let him go, and pressed his hands to
his forehead, groaning: "Oh, what a stupid fool,
what a stupid fool, what a stupid fool I am! I
might have left him alone; I might have waited
until to-morrow or the next day. But now it
is done! It is done!"</p>

<p>He seized Franco's hand. "I tell you I had
begun to undress when a sort of giddiness came
over me, and then it was all up with me. I must
needs put on the dressing-gown again, and rush
in here without a light, like a lunatic. In my
haste I even tipped over the basin of sedative
water."</p>

<p>"Shall we light the lamp?" Franco asked.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, we had better talk in the dark,
better talk in the dark! See, I am going way over
there!" And he sat down at his writing-desk,
to escape the faint glimmer of light which fell
through the window. Then he began. He always
spoke in a nervous and disorderly fashion, and
it may easily be imagined how he spoke now, in
his present state of agitation.</p>

<p>"Shall I begin? Goodness knows what you
will say, dear Don Franco! These are all useless
words, but what would you have&mdash;alas! patience&mdash;!
Well, I will begin&mdash;but where shall I begin? Oh,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Lord! just see what a fool I am, not even knowing
where to begin! Ah, that hallucination! Yes,
I told you a lie just now; I can easily guess the
origin of that hallucination. It has to do with a
letter; a letter I showed Signora Teresa two years
ago, a letter from Don Franco, your grandfather.
Well, now let us begin at the beginning.</p>

<p>"During his last days my poor father spoke to
me of a letter from Don Franco which I should
find in the strong-box, where all the important
papers were kept. He told me to read it, to
preserve it carefully, and, when the time came, to
act in accordance with the dictates of conscience.
'But' said he, 'it is almost certain there will be
nothing to be done.' My poor father passed away.
I searched the strong-box for the letter, but did
not find it. I hunted the whole house over, but
in vain. What could I do? I contented myself
with reflecting that there was nothing to be done,
and thought no more about the matter. A fool, was
I not? A real idiot! Say so freely, I deserve it.
I have said so to myself so many times! But let
us continue. Do you know how your grandfather's
estate was settled? Do you know how
the affairs of your house were arranged? You
will forgive me for speaking to you of these
matters, will you not?"</p>

<p>"I know my grandfather died without a will,
and that I have nothing," Franco replied. "But
let us pass that over, and proceed."</p>

<p>To Franco it was truly a painful subject. At
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
old Maironi's death no will had been found. In
perfect love and harmony, the widow and the son,
Don Alessandro, had divided the estate equally
between them. In order to secure this arrangement
the son had made a very large grant to his
mother, declaring that he was only carrying out
the paternal wishes, which had not found a means
of expression. This depraved young man, a
spendthrift and a gambler, was already caught in
the toils of usurers at the time of his father's
death. In the seven years he survived him he
managed to spend everything, not leaving a penny
to his only son, Franco, who found himself reduced
to some twenty thousand <i>svanziche</i>, the
fortune of his mother who had died in giving
him birth.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, let us get on," Gilardoni continued.
"Three years ago, three years ago, I say, I received
a letter from you. I remember it was the second
of November, all Souls' Day. Curious circumstance,
mysterious circumstance! Very well. That
night I went to bed, and dreamed a dream. I
dreamt of your grandfather's letter. Note that
I had never thought of it again. I dreamt I was
hunting for it, and that I found it in an old box
I keep in the attic. I read it, still dreaming. It
said there was a great treasure in the cellar of Casa
Maironi at Cressogno and that that treasure was
to come to you. I awoke in intense excitement,
convinced that this had been a prophetic dream.
I got up, and went to look in the box. I found
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
nothing; but two days later, being about to sell
certain lands which I owned at Dasio, I got out
an old deed of purchase, which my father kept in
the strong-box, and, in turning over the leaves,
a letter fell out. I glanced at the signature and
saw: Nobile Franco Maironi. I read the letter.
It was the one in question! Thus you see, the
dream...."</p>

<p>"Well," said Franco, interrupting him, "and
what did this letter say?"</p>

<p>The Professor rose, took a match half a cubit
long, ran it in among the live coals in the little
fireplace, and lit the lamp.</p>

<p>"I have it here," he said with a great, despairing
sigh. "Read it."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket and handed to Franco
a small yellowish letter, without an envelope, and
still showing traces of the little red wafer. The
yellow-black lines of writing inside showed
through here and there, almost in relief.</p>

<p>Franco took it, held it near the lamp, and read
aloud as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="signature3">"Dear Carlin,&mdash;</div>

<p>"You will find my last will enclosed in this
letter. I have written it in duplicate. One copy
I am keeping. This is the other, and I charge you
to publish it if the first be not forthcoming. Do
you understand? Very well then; and when we
meet I forbid you absolutely to worry me with
your advice, as is your d&mdash;&mdash;d custom. You
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
are the only person in whom I have confidence,
but, after all, it is my right to command, and
your duty to obey. Therefore all advice is useless
and will not be tolerated. Good-bye.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Now here is the will," said Gilardoni dolefully,
handing Franco another yellow document, "but
don't read that aloud."</p>

<p>The document read as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I, the undersigned, Nobile Franco Maironi,
desire that my estate be divided in accordance
with this, my last will and testament.</p>

<p>"Donna Orsola Maironi, born Marchesa Scremin,
having deigned to accept my homage as well as
that of many others, I bequeath to her, in proof
of my gratitude, the sum of ten thousand Milanese
Lire, to be paid once and for all, and what, to her,
is the most precious jewel of my household, namely
Don Alessandro Maironi, duly inscribed in the
parish-registers of the Cathedral of Brescia as
my son.</p>

<p>"I bequeath to my said son that part of my property
which is lawfully due to him, and three

    <a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> a day more, in token of the special
esteem in which I hold him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
    "I leave to my agent in Brescia, Signor Grigi,
should he be still in my employ at the time of my
death, all that he has stolen from me.</p>

<p>"I leave to my agent in Valsolda, Carlino Gilardoni,
upon the same condition as above, four
Milanese Lire a day, during his natural life.</p>

<p>"I desire that, during the life of Donna Orsola
Maironi Scremin, a Mass be celebrated daily in
the Cathedral of Brescia, for the good of her soul.</p>

<p>"I name and appoint my grandson, Don Franco

<p>"As witness my hand, this fifteenth day of April,
1828.</p>

<div class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Franco Maironi.</span>"
</div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Franco read&mdash;and, half dazed and without a
word, passed the sheet of paper back to the
Professor. He was shaken, but felt vaguely that
he must control himself, that he must restrain his
own agitation, collect his thoughts, and strive to
get a clear view of this matter and of himself.</p>

<p>"What do you say to that?" the Professor
exclaimed.</p>

<p>At this point Gilardoni's intense excitement
reached a climax.</p>

<p>"Why did I not speak before, eh?" he continued.
"The thing is that I can't possibly give
a clear, precise and positive reason for not having
done so. Those papers were a horror to me!
If I myself and my own father and mother had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
been involved in such a question, I would rather
have let a million slip than ask for it with those
documents in my hand. There! I have been a
fool again, to have said that! Just forget those
last words, for in your place ... it is a different
thing. I was speaking for myself. Good Lord,
of course I was speaking for myself! Well, I
thought&mdash;see what an ass I was&mdash;I thought your
grandmother just doted on you, and that your
grandfather's property would go to you anyway.
And with that idea...! After a while I
consulted Signora Teresa, and showed her the
letter and the will. She said I should have informed
you at once, as soon as I had made the
discovery, but that she could not give me any
advice because now her daughter was, in a way,
an interested party. Besides, she said.... But
that is of no consequence. In short I saw the
will was a horror to her also. Anyway, I was
convinced your grandmother would end by accepting
this marriage, and I did not speak. Tonight
you come and tell me the Marchesa has used
threats. Fancy that! Now you understand that
I could not wait, that I could not keep these
documents a moment longer. There&mdash;they are
yours&mdash;take them!"</p>

<p>Franco, absorbed in his own thoughts, heard
only these last words. "No," said he, "I will not
take them. I know myself too well. With them
in my possession I might be led into doing something
rash, or into acting prematurely. You keep
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
them for the present." Gilardoni would not hear
of keeping them, and drove Franco into one of
his fits of impatience. There was indeed nothing
so irritating to his nerves as the inconclusive outpourings
of kind-hearted but brainless persons.
Gilardoni's opposition angered him, and he gave
him to understand that this wish to rid himself
of the documents at all costs, was selfishness pure
and simple, and that those who have blundered
must bear the consequences. The words he
uttered amounted to this, but the angry and harsh
expression of his face said much more. Gilardoni,
whose face was crimson, shuddered at the
accusation of selfishness, but controlled himself
and putting on a grim frown in his turn, hastily
pocketed the documents, repeated a string of
"well, well, well, wells," and abruptly left the
room. To appease his own conscience Franco at
once set to work trying to convince himself that
Signor Beniamino was entirely in the wrong. He
had done wrong in not having given him the documents
much sooner, and now he was doing wrong
in taking offence. As he was quite sure he should
make his peace with the inconclusive philosopher,
he thought no more about him, put out the lamp,
and, returning to his easy-chair, became once more
engrossed in his previous meditations.</p>

<p>Now he was beginning to see clearly. He could
not with dignity make use of that will, which,
both in form and in substance was dishonouring
to his grandmother, arousing as it did, when the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
letter was considered, a suspicion of criminal
suppression. The will also reflected little honour
upon his father. No, never. He must tell the
professor to burn both documents.</p>

<p>"Thus, Madam Grandmother, shall I triumph
over you!" thought Franco, "Making you a free
gift of the property, and of your honour as well,
without even taking the trouble to tell you of it!"
Revelling in this thought Franco felt almost as
if he were lifted above the earth, and he drew
a long breath, vastly pleased with himself, his
soul illumined and soothed by a sentiment of
mingled generosity and pride. With all his faith
and his acts of Christian piety, he was very far
from suspecting that such a sentiment was not
entirely good, and that a less self-conscious magnanimity
would have been more noble.</p>

<p>He let himself sink back in his easy-chair,
more disposed to rest than he had been before,
thinking quietly of what he had read, of what he
had heard, as one who has been on the verge of
embarking upon some perilous speculation, and
looks back upon the anxiety and the calamities
from which he has escaped forever. Old memories
were also beginning to stir in the depths of his
soul. He recalled a certain tale an old servant
had told concerning the riches of the house of
Maironi, which, she said, had been stolen from
the poor. He was a child then, and the woman
had not hesitated to speak in his presence. But
the child had received a deep impression, and this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
impression had been re-awakened in his early
boyhood, by the words of a priest, who had confided
to him, with an air of great secrecy and
solemnity, and perhaps not without intention, that
the Maironi fortune was the fruit of a law-suit
which had been unjustly won against the Ospedale
Maggiore of Milan.</p>

<p>"So, through me," thought Franco, "everything
has gone back to the devil."</p>

<p>It struck him that perhaps it was late, so he
lighted the lamp once more, and consulted his
watch. It was half-past three. Now, it would
be impossible for him to rest. The moment which
would re-unite him to Luisa was too near at hand,
his fancy was too greatly excited. One hour and
a half more! He looked at his watch every two
minutes; it seemed as if the tedious time would
never pass. He took a book, but could not read.
He opened the window; the air was soft, the
silence profound, the lake was bright over towards
S. Salvatore, and the heavens were studded with
stars. At Oria he could see a light. Perhaps
it would be his fate to live there in Uncle Piero's
house. Gazing absently at that luminous spot,
he began to imagine what the future would be,
and ever-changing phantoms rose before him.
At about half-past four he heard a bell ring on the
lower floor, and presently Pinella came with a message
from his master to the effect that if he wished
to make the <i>ascent of the Boglia</i> it was time to start.
The master had a severe headache, and could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
neither rise nor receive him. Franco searched
on the writing-table for a sheet of paper, and
wrote:</p>

<p>"<i>Parce mihi, domine, quia brixiensis sum.</i>"</p>

<p>He went out, Pinella accompanying him with
the light as far as the dark arcade, where the road
to Castello begins. Then he disappeared.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Marchesa Orsola rang her bell at half-past
six, and ordered the maid to bring her chocolate
as usual. She swallowed more than half of it
before asking with the utmost composure, at what
hour Don Franco had returned.</p>

<p>"He has not yet returned, Signora Marchesa."</p>

<p>The old woman must have received an inward
shock, but not a muscle of her face twitched.
She placed her lips on the edge of her cup of chocolate,
looked at the maid, and said calmly:</p>

<p>"Bring me one of those little biscuits we had
yesterday."</p>

<p>Towards eight o'clock the maid came back to
say that Don Franco had returned, but only to go
directly to his room for his passport, coming down
again immediately, and he had then ordered the
footman to find a boatman who would take him
to Lugano. The Marchesa said never a word, but
later in the day she sent word to her confidant
Pasotti that she was expecting him. Pasotti
took in the situation at a glance, and remained
with her more than half an hour. The lady was
determined to find out where and how her grandson
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
had spent the night. Pasotti had already
heard some rumours, which he now repeated,
concerning a nocturnal visit of Don Franco's to
Casa Rigey; but more reliable and precise information
was desired. The cunning <i>Tartufo</i>, by
nature as curious as a hound, that goes about
following every scent, poking his nose into every
hole, and rubbing it against every pair of trowsers,
promised to furnish the Marchesa with such information
in the course of a day or two, and then
took himself off, his eyes sparkling, rubbing his
hands in anticipation of a pleasant chase.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
THE ROGUE AT WORK</h2>

<p>The next morning, Pasotti having imbibed
his coffee and milk, lay pondering the plan
of the chase until half-past ten, when he summoned
Signora Barborin, who slept in another room
because her snoring disturbed the "Controller,"
as she respectfully called her husband. "He is
quite right," the poor deaf woman would say, "it
is a terribly bad habit, this snoring of mine!" She
was older than Pasotti, whom she had accepted
as her second husband because her heart was
very susceptible, and to whom she had brought
certain moneys which he had long coveted, and
was now enjoying. The Controller was fond of
her in his own way; he obliged her to make calls,
to go on boating excursions, to take long walks
in the hills, all of which things were torments to
her. He made fun of her deafness, sent her out
covered with silks and feathers, and at home made
her work like any drudge. In spite of all this she
respected and served him like a slave, in fear and
trembling it is true, but not without affection.
When she did not call him "the Controller" she
called him "Pasotti," but she never allowed herself
to use a more familiar appellation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
    Pasotti, with a face as stern as any satrap,
ordered her by gestures to go to the drawer for
a white shirt, to the wardrobe for his second-best
suit, to a cupboard for a pair of boots. When his
wife had prepared everything, hunting anxiously
here and there, continually facing about to
follow the eyes and gestures of the master who
several times called her a fool, when she would
stare open-mouthed at him, striving to catch the
word she had only seen, Pasotti stuck his legs
out of bed, and said:</p>

<p>"Here you are!"</p>

<p>Signora Barborin knelt before him, and began
pulling on his stockings, while the Controller,
stretching out his arm to the pedestal, took his
snuff-box, and, having opened it, continued his
previous meditations, his fingers buried in the
snuff. He intended to make several visits of discovery,
but in what order should he arrange them?
From what his farmer had told him, he judged that
Signor Giacomo Puttini's Marianna, and perhaps
even Signor Giacomo himself must know something
about Don Franco, and certainly something
must be known in Castello. While Signora Barborin
was tying the second shoe-lace, Pasotti
remembered that it was Tuesday. Every Tuesday
Signor Giacomo, with a few friends, was in the
habit of going to the market at Lugano, or rather
to the tavern called "del Lordo," in order to vary
the daily wine of Grimelli by a weekly glass of an
undiluted vintage, and he often came home in an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
affectionate and communicative frame of mind.
It would therefore be better to call upon him late
in the day, say between four and five. In fancy
Pasotti was already holding him in his hand, and
managing him as he liked. With a malicious
smile he raised his fingers from the snuff-box,
shook the pinch to the proper dimensions by means
of a few gentle, even raps, enjoyed it at his leisure,
and then his wife having given him his handkerchief,
he rewarded her by mumbling with a
benign expression of countenance, as he rolled the
handkerchief into a ball: "Poor woman! poor
creature!"</p>

<p>When, after half an hour's labour he had put on
and buttoned up his coat, he exclaimed, seriously:
"What d&mdash;&mdash; hard work!" and went to the glass.
Then his wife ventured to edge cautiously towards
the door, saying very timidly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can I go now?"</p>

<p>Pasotti turned round frowning and imperious,
and beckoning to her to approach, he drew about
her head and person certain lines in the air, which
meant a hat and shawl. She did not understand,
and stood staring at him, with her mouth open.
Then she pointed her forefinger at his breast,
questioning him with her eyes, and her lifted
eyebrows, as if suspecting he wanted those articles
for himself. Pasotti answered this questioning
in the same manner, with three stabs of his forefinger,
which signified: "you, you, you!" Then,
making the motions of cutting something with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
his open hand, he gave her to understand that she
was to go out with him. She started several
times, astonished and protesting, opened her eyes
extremely wide, and said in that voice of hers
which seemed to come from the cellar:</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>The Controller's only answer was a fulminating
glance and a gesture: "march!" He did not
intend to give any further information.</p>

<p>Signora Barborin struggled a little longer.</p>

<p>"I have not breakfasted yet," she said.</p>

<p>Her husband took her by the shoulders, drew
her towards him, and shouted into her face:</p>

<p>"You will breakfast later."</p>

<p>Only at Albogasio Inferiore, in front of the
Annunziata, did he inform her, by pointing to the
place with his stick, that they were going to
Cadate, to that old manor-house planted in the
lake between Casarico and Albogasio, and generally
known as "the Palace," where there lived, all
alone, in the small rooms of the upper story, the
priest, Don Giuseppe Costabarbieri and his servant
Maria, called "Maria of the Palace." Pasotti
knowing well that both were eager listeners, but
extremely cautious in talking, wished to examine
them one at a time, without seeming to do so,
and, if he found any soft spot, he intended to press
it very gently. He had brought his wife with him
that she might help him in this delicate matter of
taking them one at a time, and she, poor innocent,
trotted on behind him with short, quick
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
steps, and followed him down the flight of one
hundred and twenty-nine steps called the "Calcinera,"
never suspecting the perfidious part she
was to act.</p>

<p>The lake was like oil, and Don Giuseppe, a fine,
pursy priest, short and fat, with white hair, a
ruddy complexion and small glistening eyes, was
seated near the fig-tree in his garden, with a black
straw hat on his head, and a white handkerchief
round his neck, angling for carp, certain big, fat
carp, grown old and wary, that might be seen
moving about very slowly under the water, all
for love of the figs, and that were as inquisitive
and, at the same time, as cautious as the priest
and his servant. This latter was not visible.
Pasotti finding the street-door open, went in, calling
out for Don Giuseppe and Maria. As no one
answered he planted his wife in a chair and went
down into the garden, making straight for the
fig-tree, where Don Giuseppe was sitting, who, on
catching sight of him, went into a fit of ceremonious
convulsions. He threw down his fishing-rod
and went towards Pasotti vociferating: "Oh,
Lord! Oh, Lord! Oh, dear me! In this state!
My dear Controller! Come up-stairs! Come up-stairs!
My dear Controller! In this state! I
hope you will excuse me! I hope you will excuse
me!" But Pasotti would not hear of "going
up," he was bound to remain where he was. Don
Giuseppe began bawling for "Maria! Maria!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Presently Maria's big face appeared at a window
in the upper story.</p>

<p>Don Giuseppe called to her to bring down a
chair. Then the Controller revealed the presence
of his wife, whereupon the big face disappeared
and Don Giuseppe had another fit.</p>

<p>"How is this? How is this? Signora Barborin?
She here? Oh, Lord! Come up-stairs!"
and he started forward impelled by obsequiousness,
but Pasotti reduced him to obedience, at
first catching him by the arm, and then declaring
that he wished to see him take one or two of those
monstrous carp; and notwithstanding Don Giuseppe's
protests: "It is no use! I sha'n't catch
anything! They're far too cunning, these fish.
<i>They see!</i>" in the end he was obliged to throw
his line.</p>

<p>At first Pasotti pretended to watch him, but
finally he also threw his line.</p>

<p>He began by asking Don Giovanni how long
it was since he had been to Castello. Upon being
informed that he had been there the day before
to see his friend, the curate Intrioni, the good
Tartuffe, who could not abide Intrioni, burst
into a perfect panegyric of him. What a jewel,
this curate of Castello! What a heart of gold!
And had Don Giuseppe been to Casa Rigey?
No, Signora Teresa was too ill. More panegyrics
concerning Signora Teresa and Luisa. What a
splendid creature! What circumspection, what
high principles, what sentiment! And the Maironi
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
affair? It was still going on, was it not?
Had it gone far?</p>

<p>"I know nothing, nothing, nothing!" Don
Giuseppe said sharply.</p>

<p>At that hasty denial Pasotti's eyes sparkled.
He took a step forward. Oh, come now. It was
not possible that Don Giuseppe did not know
anything! It was not possible that he had not
discussed the matter with Intrioni! Was not
Intrioni aware that Don Franco had spent the
night at Casa Rigey?</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it, nothing at all!"
Don Giuseppe repeated.</p>

<p>Then Pasotti declared that by this concealment
of certain well known circumstances, many were
led to suspect evil. What the deuce! Don
Franco had of course gone to Casa Rigey with the
most honourable intentions, therefore&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"A bite! A bite!" whispered Don Giuseppe
hurriedly, and he leaned far out over the parapet,
grasped the end of the pole firmly, and fixed
his gaze on the water as if a fish were about to
seize the hook. "A bite!"</p>

<p>Pasotti, much vexed, gazed into the water also,
but declared he could see nothing.</p>

<p>"He has made off, the wretch! But his mouth
almost touched the hook. He must have felt
the prick!" said Don Giuseppe, sighing and
straightening himself up. He also had felt the
prick of the hook, and was trying to "make off"
as the fish had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
    The other renewed his attack, but in vain. Don
Giuseppe had seen nothing, heard nothing, talked
of nothing, knew nothing. Pasotti was silent,
and the priest in turn, threw out a bit of timid
malice: "They don't bite well to-day,&mdash;there
must be something in the air."</p>

<p>In the house, meanwhile, the dialogue between
Maria and Signora Barborin had proceeded most
unsatisfactorily, after the first affectionate exchange
of greetings, which had been a great success.
Maria proposed by gestures that they go
into the garden, but Signora Pasotti begged with
clasped hands, to be allowed to remain in her chair.
Then the big Maria took another chair, and seating
herself beside her guest tried to talk to her. But
she found it impossible to make her understand,
no matter how she shrieked, so gave up in despair,
and taking her great cat upon her lap, talked to
him instead.</p>

<p>Poor Signora Barborin, who was quite resigned,
watched the cat with her great black eyes, dimmed
by age and grief. Ah! here was Pasotti at last,
with Don Giuseppe, who at once began to puff
out his:</p>

<p>"Oh, good Lord! My dear Signora Barborin!
Pray excuse me!" Maria having confessed to the
<i>Scior Controlor</i> that his wife and she had not been
able to understand each other, her master&mdash;as a
mark of respect for Signora Pasotti&mdash;called the
servant a "block head," and, as she attempted
to justify herself, he prudently checked her by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
an imperious wave of the hand and a string of
"there, there, there's." Then he signalled to her
mysteriously with his head, and she left the room.
Pasotti followed her, and told her that his wife
really felt obliged to call on the Rigeys, but was
in doubt as to how she should act, having heard
certain rumours which were current, and that she
had greatly hoped to gain some information from
Maria, for "Maria always knew everything."</p>

<p>"What foolish talk!" said Maria, much flattered.
"I never know anything; but I can tell you to
whom your wife must apply. To Signor Giacomo
Puttini. It is Signor Giacomo Puttini who always
knows everything."</p>

<p>"Well done!" thought Pasotti, adding these
remarks to what the farmer had said, and concluding
he was on the track at last. At the same
time he shrugged his shoulders incredulously.
Signor Giacomo might perhaps be aware of what
was going on in the moon, but that was all; he
never knew anything else. Maria insisted, and
the old fox began to press her with questions,
beating cautiously about the bush; but he found
her obdurate, and presently he saw that he should
have his labour for his pains, and that he must be
satisfied with that one bit of information. He
became silent, and half satisfied, half preoccupied,
returned to the room where Don Giuseppe was
explaining to Signora Barborin, by means of
appropriate gestures, that Maria was going to
bring her something to eat. In fact the woman
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
appeared presently with a square, glass jar, full
of brandy-cherries, a renowned specialty of Don
Giuseppe's, who was in the habit of offering them
solemnly to his guests, in his own peculiar Italian:</p>

<p>"Allow me to offer you something! Will you
try a few of my cherries? <i>Magara con un tochello
di pane?</i> Perhaps with a slice of bread?" And
then, lapsing into dialect once more: "<i>Maria,
tajee gio un poo de pan</i>&mdash;cut off a bit of bread."</p>

<p>Signora Barborin feasted on bread alone,
following the advice of her satanic husband, who
himself took cherries without bread. Then they
went away together, and she was permitted to
return to Albogasio, while the Controller set off
in the direction of Casa Gilardoni.</p>

<p>"That Pasotti is a rogue," said Maria when she
had bolted the street-door.</p>

<p>"He is not only a rogue, but an extra big rogue!
A <i>bargnif</i>!" Don Giuseppe exclaimed, remembering
the hook; and by the application of the
dialect title of "Bargnif," which means the arch-fiend,
considered in the light of his great cunning,
these two mild beings found relief for their feelings,
and a compensation for so many things given
unwillingly: courtesies, smiles and cherries.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Professor Gilardoni was reading perched on his
belvedere in the kitchen-garden, when he caught
sight of Pasotti coming towards him behind
Pinella, between the rows of beets and turnips.
He had little liking for the Controller, with whom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
he had exchanged only one or two calls, and who
had the reputation of being a <i>tedescone</i>, a rank
German. Nevertheless, being inclined to think
the best of those with whom he was only slightly
acquainted, he found no difficulty in extending
to him the same cordial courtesy which it was his
habit to show to every one. He went to meet his
guest, velvet cap in hand, and after a skirmish of
compliments which proved an easy victory for
Pasotti, Gilardoni returned to the belvedere
with him.</p>

<p>Pasotti, on the other hand, felt a lively dislike
for the Professor, not so much because he knew
him to be a Liberal, as because, though Gilardoni
did not go to Mass as often as he himself did, he
lived like a Puritan, loving neither the table nor
the bottle, neither tobacco nor certain loose discourses.
Moreover he did not play <i>tarocchi</i>. One
evening, when talking in the kitchen-garden with
Don Franco, of the tremendous bouts of eating
and drinking which Pasotti and his friends often
celebrated in the taverns of Bisnago, the Professor
had said something which was overheard
by the big curate, one of the gluttons, whose boat,
in which he himself sat fishing, happened to be
gliding along very softly, close to the walls.
"Miserable knave!" the most worthy Controller
had exclaimed when the words were repeated to
him, his face wearing the expression of a <i>bargnif
bilioso</i>, of Satan with a bilious attack. The
exclamation had been followed by a contemptuous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
snarl, after which the Controller spat
protestingly. This, however, did not prevent
him from overflowing on the present occasion with
excuses for having unduly postponed his visit, nor
from immediately spying out the volume resting on
the rustic table of the belvedere. Gilardoni saw
him glance at it and, as the book in question was
one of those forbidden by the government, he
took it up almost instinctively as soon as he had
started the conversation, and rested it on his knee
in such a manner that Pasotti could not read the
title. This precaution disturbed Pasotti, who
was just then praising the little villa and the
garden in all their particulars, and in the tone
best adapted to each part; the beets, with amiable
familiarity, the aloes, with serious and frowning
admiration. An angry light flashed in his eyes,
and then disappeared.</p>

<p>"Fortunate man," he sighed. "If my affairs
would permit it, I myself should like to live in
Valsolda."</p>

<p>"It is a peaceful spot," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"Yes, a peaceful spot; and, besides, nowadays
those who have served the Government are not
comfortable in the big towns. People make no
distinction between a faithful official who attends
strictly to his own duties, as I have done, and a
police-spy. We are exposed to many suspicions,
many humiliations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Professor turned red, and was sorry he
had removed the book from the little table. In
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
fact, notwithstanding his assumption of humility,
Pasotti was too proud to act the spy, and, owing
to this pride, or perhaps to some good strain in
him, he had never done so. Thus in his words
there was a grain of sincerity, a grain of gold,
which sufficed to give them the ring of true metal.
Gilardoni, touched by this, offered his guest a
glass of beer, and hastened away in search of
Pinella, glad of an excuse for leaving the book
on the little table.</p>

<p>Hardly had the Professor disappeared when
Pasotti snatched up the volume, and gave it an
inquisitive glance; then he laid it down on the
same spot, and stationed himself at the top of the
steps, toying with the snuff in the box he held open
in his hand, and smiling a smile half of beatitude,
half of admiration, at the lake, the hills and the
sky. The book was a volume of Giusti, pretending
to have been published in Brussels or rather
<i>Brusselle</i>, and bearing the title: <i>Italian Poems,
from manuscripts</i>. Written across one corner of
the fly-leaf was the name: "Mariano Fornic."
It needed less keenness than Pasotti possessed to
perceive at once in that heteroclite, the anagram
of Franco Maironi.</p>

<p>"How lovely! What a paradise!" said he
softly, while the Professor was coming up the steps
followed by Pinella with the beer.</p>

<p>Presently, between two sips of beer, he confessed
that his visit was not entirely of a disinterested
nature. He declared that he was in love
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
with the blossoming wall that upheld the kitchen-garden
on the lake-side, and that he wished to
copy it at Albogasio Superiore, where, though the
lake was wanting, there were plenty of bare walls.
Where did the Professor get those aloes, those
roses and caper-bushes?</p>

<p>"Why," the other answered frankly. "Maironi
gave them to me."</p>

<p>"Don Franco?" Pasotti exclaimed. "Well
done! I will appeal to Don Franco, who is always
very kind to me."</p>

<p>And he took out his snuff-box. "Poor Don
Franco," said he, with all the tenderness of a compassionate
rogue as he scrutinised and fingered
the snuff. "Poor young man! He sometimes
flies into a passion, but, after all, he is a splendid
fellow. A heart of the best! Poor young man!
Do you see him often?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite often."</p>

<p>"If only his hopes could be realised, poor young
man! His hopes and hers also, of course. That
affair is not off, is it?"</p>

<p>Pasotti put this question with the skill of a
great actor, with affectionate but discreet interest,
with no more curiosity than was fitting, and with
the intention of lubricating and softening somewhat
Gilardoni's closed heart, that it might open
of itself, little by little. But Gilardoni's heart,
instead of spreading itself open at that gentle
touch, contracted and closed tighter than ever.</p>

<p>"I don't know," the Professor replied, feeling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the colour mounting to his face, and indeed he
turned scarlet. In his mental note-book Pasotti
immediately made a note of the embarrassed
manner, and of the heightened colour. "He
would be unwise to throw up the game. It is
only natural that the Marchesa should create
difficulties for them, but after all, she is a good
creature, and devoted to him. Poor woman,
what a fright she had the other night!"</p>

<p>He glanced at the Professor who was frowning
in uneasy silence, and reflected: You will not
speak? Then you know. "Just think of it!
Not to say where he was going! What do you
think of that?"</p>

<p>"But I know nothing about it, I don't understand."
Gilardoni exclaimed, frowning more
darkly still and growing ever more uneasy.</p>

<p>And now Pasotti, who was aware that the Professor
had long since ceased to visit the Rigeys,
but was ignorant of the reason why, made a move
which was worthy only of a novice in roguery.</p>

<p>"You might enquire about it at Castello."
said he, with a malicious simper.</p>

<p>At this point Gilardoni, who was already boiling
with rage, overflowed.</p>

<p>"Pray oblige me by dropping this subject,"
said he, angrily, "oblige me by dropping it."</p>

<p>Pasotti grew sullen. Ceremonious, insinuating,
and given to adulation though he was, his pride
would not allow him to suffer an unpleasant word
calmly, and he took offence at every shadow. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
said no more, and in a few minutes took his leave
with dignified coolness, and retired through the
beets and the turnips, nursing his wrath. On
reaching the top of the Contrada dei Mal'ari, the
<i>bargnif</i> paused a moment to think, resting his chin
on his hand, then he started towards the shore of
Casarico, moving slowly, his head bent low, but
with glistening eyes, like the poodle that smells
the hidden truffle in the air. Don Giuseppe's
frightened denials, Maria's obstinate denials, and
the Professor's embarrassment and outburst of
temper, told him that a truffle really existed, and
that it must be a big one. He had thought of
going to Loggi where dwelt Paolin and Paolon,
both of whom were well informed, but then he
had remembered that it was Tuesday, and that
probably he would not find them. No, it would
be better to go directly up to Castello from Casarico,
and sniff and hunt about in the house of a
certain Signora Cecca, an admirable woman, all
heart, and famous for the assiduous watch she
kept from her window over the entire Valsolda
by means of a powerful spy-glass. She could tell
you any day who had gone to Lugano with the
boatman Pin, or with Panighet; noted the conversations
the unhappy Pinella held with a certain
Mochét in front of the church at Albogasio,
half a mile distant; she knew how many days it
had taken Engineer Ribera to drink the little cask
of wine which his boat carried back empty from
the house at Oria to the cellar at S. Margherita.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
If Franco had been to Casa Rigey Signora Cecca
must surely know it.</p>

<p>In the passage that leads from Casarico to the
narrow street of Castello, Pasotti heard hurried
steps behind him, and then some one brushed past
him in the darkness and he believed he had
recognised a man nicknamed "légora fugada" or
the "hunted hare," because of the furious pace
at which he always walked. This honest man,
who was even more inquisitive than Pasotti, was
a most worthy person who loved to know things
just for the sake of knowing them, and for no
other reason. He always went about alone, was
everywhere, appearing and disappearing like a
flash, sometimes in one place, sometimes in another,
like certain large, winged insects, which
pass with a glance, a whirr, a touch, and then,
hush! they are neither heard nor seen again until
there comes another glance, another whirr, another
touch. He had seen the Pasottis enter the
"Palace," and the unusual hour had caused him
to suspect something. Lying flat in a small
field he had seen Signora Barborin turn homewards,
and the Controller start towards Casarico.
Then, having followed at a distance, this individual
had posted himself behind one of the pilasters
of the portico of Casarico while Pasotti was calling
on Gilardoni, and now he had slipped past him,
taking advantage of the dark passage, and hastening
to reach Castello before him, that he might
watch his movements from some point of vantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
    In fact he saw him enter Signora Cecca's house.</p>

<p>The old lady, who had the goitre, was in her
little parlour, holding a small urchin on her left
arm, while with her free hand she supported a
very long and slender pasteboard tube, which was
struck slanting across the window like a wall-gun
and pointed down at the sparkling lake, at a
white sail, filled with the <i>breva</i>. On the entrance
of Pasotti, who came forward with stooping
shoulders, his face suffused with a most gentle
gaiety, the kindly and hospitable old dame
hastened to put down the monstrous pasteboard
nose, which she was so fond of poking into the
most distant affairs of others, where her own
parchment nose, though it was long beyond
measure, could not reach. She received the
Controller as she might have received a saintly
miracle-worker, who had come to remove her
goitre.</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind of you! Dear <i>Sior Controlor</i>!
Oh, how kind! What a pleasure! What a
pleasure!"</p>

<p>And she made him sit down and nearly suffocated
him with her offers of hospitality.</p>

<p>"A piece of cake! A bit of nut-candy! Dear
<i>Sior Controlor</i>! A little wine! A taste of
<i>rosoho</i>!&mdash;You must excuse me," she added, for
the youngster had begun to whine. "He is my
little grandson, you know. My little pet."</p>

<p>Pasotti took a great deal of urging, having not
only Don Giovanni's cherries, but also Gilardoni's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
beer in his stomach, but finally he was obliged to
yield, and resign himself to gnawing a piece of
that accursed almond cake, while the urchin clung
to his grandmother's goitre.</p>

<p>At this the sarcastic rogue said pathetically,
laughing in his sleeve the while: "Poor Signora
Cecca! Twice a mother!" When he had enquired
for her husband and for all her descendants
even unto the third generation, he brought forward
Signora Teresa Rigey. How was that
poor lady? Bad! Really very bad? But since
when had she been worse? Had there been any
cause? Some trouble, perhaps? The old troubles
were well known, but had there been some fresh
ones? Perhaps on Luisina's account? About
the marriage? And did Don Franco come to
Castello? Ah, not in the daytime, but perhaps&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>As the patient who is being questioned and
examined by the surgeon searching for the painful,
hidden spot, answers ever more briefly, ever more
fearfully as the hand draws nearer and nearer to
the point, and starts and draws back as soon as
the spot is touched, so Signora Cecca answered
Pasotti ever more briefly, ever more cautiously,
until, at that "but" which touched the painful
spot so delicately, she started, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"A little more cake, <i>Sior Controlor</i>! It is a
cake light enough for young girls."</p>

<p>Pasotti in his heart cursed the "young girls"
and their cake, a concoction of honey, chalk and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
almond oil, but deemed it prudent to swallow
another mouthful before once more touching, or
rather pressing the tender spot he had discovered.</p>

<p>"I know nothing! I know nothing! Absolutely
nothing!" Signora Cecca exclaimed.
"Try sounding Puttini. Try Signor Giacomo.
And pray don't ask me anything more." Again!
Pasotti's face shone at the prospect of getting the
unlucky Signor Giacomo into his clutches. Thus
the eyes of a falcon might shine at the joyous
prospect of snatching a frog, and of holding him
in his claws, to toy with at pleasure. Presently
he took his departure well satisfied with everything
save with the chalky cake, which lay like
lead in his stomach.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Casa Puttini, which, within its minute, genteel
appearance, resembled the little old gentleman
who ruled it, in a black coat and white stock,
stood just below that stately pile, Casa Pasotti,
on the road to Albogasio Inferiore. The falcon
went there in the afternoon, towards five o'clock,
with a cunning expression on his face. He
knocked at the door and then listened. He was
there! The unlucky frog was there! And he
was quarrelling as usual with the perfidious servant.
Pasotti knocked louder. "Go down!"
said Signor Giacomo, but Marianna would not
hear of going down to open the door. "Go down!
I am the master!" It was all in vain. Pasotti
knocked again, knocked like a battering-ram.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
"Who the devil can it be!" scolded Puttini, and
he came down puffing: "Apff! apff!" to open the
door. "Oh, most gracious Controller!" said he
winking hard, and raising his eyebrows pathetically.
"Pray excuse me! That awful servant!
I am quite worn out! You would not believe the
things that go on in this house!"</p>

<p>"That is a lie!" Marianna cried from above.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you!" And then Signor
Giacomo began telling his woes, stopping from
time to time to silence the protests of the invisible
servant.</p>

<p>"Just fancy! This morning I went to Lugano.
I got home about three o'clock. On the doorstep&mdash;look
there&mdash;I saw some splashes. Hold
your tongue, you! I did not heed them, and
went straight in. At the head of the kitchen-stairs
there were more splashes. Be quiet, will
you?&mdash;What can have been spilled? said I to myself,
and I stooped and touched the spots with my
finger. It was something greasy; I smelt it, it
was oil. Then I followed the splashes, touching
and sniffing, sniffing and touching. All oil, most
gracious Controller! So I said to myself again:
Either it came in, or it went out. If it came in,
the farmer brought it, and in that case there will
be splashes outside the door, and they will extend
upwards, if it went out, that means that this
accursed.... Hold your tongue, I say!...
took it to S. Mamette and sold it, and then the
splashes outside will extend downwards. So
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
back I went, always following the splashes and
presently I found myself here at the door. Most
gracious Controller, those splashes all extended
downwards! That d&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point the servant's voice rang out like
the bell on an alarm-clock, and no "hold your
tongue" was strong enough to stem that shrill
flow of angry words. Pasotti tried, and not
succeeding, flew into a passion himself, and
shouted: "Oh, you cheat!" following up that
title with a string of insults, at each of which
Signor Giacomo gave a low grunt of satisfaction.
"Yes, yes, give it to her! that's right! I am
much obliged to you. Yes, shout,&mdash;that's right.
You torment, you!&mdash;I am really greatly obliged
to you, most gracious Controller! Really greatly
obliged!"</p>

<p>When Marianna had been overpowered and
reduced to silence, Pasotti told Signor Giacomo
that he must speak a few words with him. "I
am really not up to it," the little man complained.
"You must excuse me, for I feel quite ill."</p>

<p>"Not up to it, not up to it, indeed!" shouted
Marianna who had revived. "You had better
tell us how you wear yourself out going up to
Castello at night to see the girls!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," Puttini shrieked, while
Pasotti exclaimed, with a fiendish grin: "What,
what, what!" Seeing that Puttini was becoming
furious, he took him by the arm, and
calming him with peaceful and affectionate language,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
dragged him away to his own house where
he at once summoned his wife, and started a
game of three-handed <i>tarocchi</i>, with the purpose
of soothing the poor frog, and getting a firmer grip
of him.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If Signora Barborin played badly, Signor
Giacomo, meditating, pondering and puffing,
played worse. He was an extremely timid player,
and never set himself up alone against the other
two, but to-day at the very first deal, he discovered
that he held such extraordinary cards
that he was seized with a fit of courage, and, to
use the language of the game, he <i>entered</i>. "Goodness
knows what sort of a hand he has!" Pasotti
growled.</p>

<p>"I don't say.... I don't say....
There certainly are several friars who walk in
slippers."</p>

<p>Signor Giacomo's "I don't say" meant that he
held marvellous cards, and the friars in slippers,
in his lingo, were the four kings of the game.
While he was getting ready to play, feasting his
eyes upon his cards, and feeling each one in turn,
Pasotti took the opportunity of opening fire,
hoping to make him lose the game, into the bargain.
"Come now," said he, "tell us about it!
When was it you went to Castello at night?"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Don't talk about it,"
Signor Giacomo replied, growing very red and
sorting his cards faster than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
    "Well, well, play away then. We can talk
later. I know the whole story any way!"</p>

<p>Poor Signor Giacomo, how could he play with
that bone in his throat? He sorted and puffed,
led when he should not have done so, blundered
in adding up the points, lost two of the friars and
their slippers as well, and in spite of his splendid
hand, left several markers in the clutches of Pasotti
who was grinning with delight, and several more
on the little plate beside Signora Barborin, who
kept repeating with clasped hands: "What have
you done, Signor Giacomo? what have you
done?"</p>

<p>Pasotti gathered up the cards and began shuffling
them, casting sardonic glances at Signor
Giacomo, who did not know where to look.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he, "I know everything.
Signora Cecca told me the whole story. I assure
you, my dear Political Deputy, you will be called
upon to answer for this before the Imperial and
Royal Commissary of Porlezza."</p>

<p>With these words Pasotti passed the cards to
Puttini, that he might cut. But Puttini, hearing
that dreaded name, began to groan:</p>

<p>"Oh Lord! Oh Lord! What is that you say?...
I know nothing.... Oh Lord!
The Imperial and Royal Commissary?... I
assure you I can't see what for! ... apff!"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Pasotti repeated. He was waiting
for a word that should enlighten him, and by
pointing first to the door and then to his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
mouth, he made his wife understand that she was
to fetch something to drink.</p>

<p>"And that dreadful engineer as well!" Signor
Giacomo exclaimed, as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>As the fisherman who, pulling hard on the long,
heavy line quivering, he fancies, with the weight
of the one big fish he has been angling for so long,
finally redoubles his caution and skill, as, with
a thrill, he sees two great shadowy fishes instead
of one rising from the depths, so Pasotti, upon hearing
this allusion to the engineer, was thrilled and
amazed, and began preparing, with the most
exquisitely delicate touch, to draw out this secret
concerning Signor Giacomo and Ribera.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said he, "you did wrong."</p>

<p>Silence on Signor Giacomo's part.</p>

<p>Pasotti insisted.</p>

<p>"You did very wrong."</p>

<p>But just then Signora Barborin entered, smiling
genially, and bearing a tray with the bottle and
glasses. The wine was of a dark red, shot through
with ruby lights, and Signor Giacomo contemplated
it if not yet tenderly, at least benevolently.
This wine had an aroma of austere virtue, and
Signor Giacomo smelt of it affectionately, gazed
at it with emotion, and then smelt of it again.
This wine had that mellow richness which fills
both palate and soul with its flavour, and indeed it
possessed exactly that honest and pure tartness
that its aroma pre-announced, and Signor Giacomo
sipped it and wished it were not liquid and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
evanescent, tasted it, smacked his lips over it, and
rolled it under his tongue. When, from time to
time, he rested his glass on the little table, neither
his hand nor his languid gaze were withdrawn
from it.</p>

<p>"Poor Engineer! Poor Ribera!" Pasotti exclaimed.
"He is a most upright man, but ..."</p>

<p>And as he pulled and pulled the unlucky Signor
Giacomo began to rise to the hook and the line.</p>

<p>"I myself did not wish it," he said. "'Twas
he made me go&mdash;'Come along,' said he. 'Why
do you not wish to go? There will be no harm
done. The thing is honest.' 'Yes!' I answered,
'so it seems to me also, but all this secrecy?' 'On
account of the grandmother,' he replied. 'But
then,' I asked, 'what sort of a figure shall you and
I cut?' 'We are just a couple of simpletons!'
he answered, with that way of his&mdash;honest, old-fashioned
soul that he is,&mdash;that always gets round
me. 'I will go,' said I."</p>

<p>Here he paused. Pasotti waited a while, and
then gave the line a cautious jerk. "The trouble
is," said he, "that the story leaked out at Castello."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir, and I was sure it would. The family
and the engineer might keep the secret, and of
course I should never speak, but the priest and
the sacristan would surely talk."</p>

<p>The priest? The sacristan? Ah! at last Pasotti
understood. He staggered! He had not
expected such a tremendous disclosure. He
filled the unhappy Signor Giacomo's glass, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
had little difficulty in getting all the particulars
of the wedding out of him. Then he tried to find
out what plans for the future the young people
had formed, but in this he did not succeed. He
began shuffling the cards with the intention of
continuing the game, but Signor Giacomo looked
at his watch, and found that it wanted only nine
minutes to seven, at which hour he was in the
habit of winding his clock. Three minutes in the
street, two minutes on the stairs, and there remained
only four minutes for leave-taking.
"Reckon it out for yourself, most gracious Controller.
It is as I say: there is no doubt about it."</p>

<p>Signora Bardorin, noticing this consultation,
questioned her husband about it. Pasotti raised
his hands to his mouth, and shouted into her
face: "He wants to go and see his sweetheart!"
"What nonsense! What nonsense!" poor Signor
Giacomo exclaimed, turning all colours; and
Signora Pasotti, having understood by a miracle,
opened her mouth enormously wide, not knowing
whether or no to believe her husband. "His
sweetheart? Oh, what nonsense. It is foolish
talk, is it not, Signor Giacomo? Of course you
might have a sweetheart, I don't deny that.
You're not old, but...!" Seeing that he
really intended to be off, she tried to detain him,
telling him she had some chestnuts from Venegono
on the fire, which were nearly done, and begging
him to accept some of them. But neither the
chestnuts nor Pasotti's reproaches could persuade
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Signor Giacomo, and he departed with the spectre
of the Imperial and Royal Commissary in his
heart, harassed by unpleasant twinges of conscience,
and a vague sense of dissatisfaction with
himself, which he could not explain, and feeling
instinctively that the perfidious servant's insolence
was, after all, preferable to Pasotti's cajoleries.</p>

<p>As to the latter, his eyes shone even brighter
than usual. He intended going to Cressogno at
once. Being an indefatigable walker he expected
to get there by eight o'clock. He was
hugely pleased at the prospect of going to the
Marchesa with his great discovery <i>in pectore</i>, of
acting mysteriously, of dropping the most artful
hints, one by one, and of obliging her to wrest the
particulars from him. For his own gratification
he was already preparing a gentle and soothing
little speech to lay upon the wound of the imperturbable
old dame, so that she might not be
able to hide it, and that no one might complain
of him, not even Franco. He went to the kitchen
where he got them to light a lantern for him, for
the night was very dark, and then he set out.</p>

<p>At the door he met his steward who was just
coming in. The steward greeted him, and carried
a large basket of fruit into the kitchen, and, having
helped the maid put it away, he seated himself
by the fire, and said placidly:</p>

<p>"Signora Teresa of Castello has just passed
away."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE OLD LADY OF MARBLE</h2>

<p>The door was opened a little way, very, very
softly; the maid looked in, and called to
Franco, who was absorbed in prayer, kneeling by
a chair near the couch upon which the dead woman
lay. Franco did not hear, and it was Luisa who
rose. She went to listen to the woman's whispered
request, said something in reply, and when
the maid had withdrawn, stood waiting for some
one. As no one appeared she pushed the door
open and said aloud: "Come in, come in." A
great sob answered her. Luisa stretched out both
hands and Professor Gilardoni seized them. They
stood some time thus, motionless, fighting their
sorrow with tightly pressed lips, he more shaken
than she. Luisa was the first to move. She
gently withdrew one hand, and, with the other,
led the Professor into the chamber of death.</p>

<p>Signora Teresa had passed away in the drawing-room
in the armchair from which she had never
been able to rise after the night of the wedding.
They had made the sofa into a funeral couch, and
laid her out upon it. The sweet face rested there
on the pillow, showing waxen in the light of the
four candles, the lips were slightly parted, and it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
was as if a smile shone through the closed eyelids.
The couch and the clothes were strewn with
autumn flowers; cyclamen, dahlias and chrysanthemums.
"See how beautiful she is," said
Luisa, in a tender, quiet tone that went to the
heart. The Professor stood leaning upon a chair
at some distance from the bed.</p>

<p>"Do you realise it, Mamma," Luisa said softly,
"how much you are beloved?"</p>

<p>She knelt down, and taking one of the dead
hands, began kissing it, caressing it, and murmuring
sweet words over it in a low voice; then
she was silent, and, replacing the hand, she rose,
kissed the brow and contemplated the face with
clasped hands. She recalled her mother's reproofs
in past years, remembering every one
since her childhood, for she had always felt them
deeply. Once more she fell upon her knees, and
pressed her lips to the icy hand with an impulse
of affection more ardent than if she had been
dwelling upon past caresses. Then taking a
cyclamen from her mother's shoulder, she rose
and offered it to the Professor. He took it, weeping,
and going to Franco, whom he now met for
the first time since that night, he embraced him
with silent emotion, and felt his embrace returned.
Then, stepping very softly, he left the room.</p>

<p>It was striking eight o'clock. Signora Teresa
had died the night before at six; in twenty-six
hours Luisa had never rested for a moment, and
had left the room only four or five times for a few
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
minutes. Franco it was who often went out, and
remained away a long time.</p>

<p>Summoned in secret he had reached Castello
just in time to see the poor mother alive, and it
had fallen to his lot to perform all the sad offices
which death imposes, for Uncle Piero, in spite of
his years, had not the slightest knowledge of these
matters, and was greatly bewildered by them.</p>

<p>Now, hearing it strike eight, he went to his
wife and gently urged her to take a little rest, but
Luisa answered him at once in a way that put an
end to his insistence. The funeral was to take
place the next morning at nine o'clock. She had
wished it to be postponed for as long as possible,
and intended to remain with her mother to the
last. In her slim person there was an indomitable
vigour capable of withstanding still greater trials.
For her, her mother was there still, on that narrow
couch, among the flowers. She did not think that
a part of her was elsewhere, did not look out of the
west window, seeking her among the tiny stars
that trembled above the hills of Carona. Her
one thought was that in a few hours, the darling
mother, who had lived so many years for her
alone, caring for naught else on earth save her
happiness, would be laid away to sleep for ever
under the great walnut-trees of Looch, in the
shadowy solitude where the little cemetery of
Castello rests in silence, while she herself would
continue to enjoy life, the sun, and love. She
had answered Franco almost sharply as if, in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
some way, affection for the living were an offence
to the affection for the dead. Then, fearing she
had hurt him, she repented, kissed him and endeavoured
to pray, knowing that in this she would
be pleasing him, and that certainly her mother
would have expected this of her. She began
reciting the <i>Pater</i>, the <i>Ave</i> and the <i>Requiem</i> over
and over again, but without deriving the slightest
comfort from them, experiencing, rather, a secret
irritation, an unwelcome drying up of her grief.
She had always practised religion, but, after the
ardour of her first Communion had died out, her
soul had ceased to be associated in religious observance.
Her mother had lived rather for the
next world than for this; she had regulated her
every action, her every word, her every thought
with that end in view. In her precocious intellectual
development, Luisa's ideas and sentiments
had taken another direction, with that
determined vigour which was one of her characteristics.
She covered these views, however,
with certain half-conscious, half-unconscious dissimulations,
partly for love of her mother, partly
because some germ of religion, sown by maternal
precepts, fostered by example, and strengthened
by habit, had not died out. Since her fourteenth
year she had been growing ever more inclined to
look beyond this present life, and at the same
time not to consider herself; to live for others, for
the earthly good of others, but always, however,
according to a strong and fierce sense of justice.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
She went to church, performed the external duties
of her religion, without incredulity, but also without
the conviction that they were pleasing to
God. She had a confused conception of a God so
great, so lofty, that no immediate contact was
possible between Him and mankind. Sometimes,
indeed, she feared she might be mistaken, but her
possible error seemed to her of a nature such as no
God of infinite goodness might punish. She
herself did not know how she had come to think
thus.</p>

<p>The door opened very softly once more, and a
low voice called, "Signor Don Franco." When
Luisa was alone she ceased to pray, and resting
her head upon her mother's pillow, she pressed
her lips to the dear shoulder, closed her eyes and
let the flood of memories flow over her that sprung
from that touch, from that familiar odour of
lavender. Her mother's dress was of silk, her
best, and had been a present from Uncle Piero.
She had worn it only once, some years before, on
the occasion of a visit to the Marchesa Marioni.
The odour of the lavender brought back this
memory also, and with it came scalding tears,
acrid with tenderness and with another sentiment
that was not actually hatred, that was not actually
anger, but that held the bitterness of both.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Franco could not at once account for the shudder
that shook him when he heard his name called.
Early that morning Uncle Piero had written to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Marchesa, announcing his sister's death in simple
but most respectful language, and had enclosed
a note from Franco himself, which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Grandmother</span>,&mdash;I have not time to
write to you because I am here, but I will tell you
all by word of mouth to-morrow evening. I hope
you will listen to me as my father and mother
would have listened."</p>
</div>

<p>No answer had as yet come from Cressogno, but
now a man from Cressogno had brought a letter.
Where was this man?&mdash;Gone; he would not stop
a minute. Franco took the letter and read the
address: "<i>Al. preg. Signor Ingegnere Pietro Ribera</i>."
At the same time he recognised in the
writing, the hand of the agent's daughter. He
went up to Uncle Piero's room at once. The
engineer, who was worn out, had gone to bed.</p>

<p>When Franco brought him the letter he showed
neither surprise nor curiosity, but said, calmly:</p>

<p>"Open it."</p>

<p>Franco placed the light on the chest of drawers,
and opened the letter, keeping his back to the bed.
As he stood, he seemed turned to stone; he neither
breathed nor moved.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the uncle.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"I understand," the old man added. Then
Franco let the letter fall, and stretching his hands
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
above his head, he uttered a long "Ah!" deep and
hoarse, and laden with amazement and horror.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" Uncle Piero repeated, "what
about this letter?"</p>

<p>Franco roused himself, and hastened to embrace
him, hardly able to restrain his sobs.</p>

<p>The placid man bore this storm calmly and
patiently for a time, but presently he began to
defend himself, and demanded the letter. "Let
me see it, let me see it," said he, and he muttered,
"What can that blessed woman have written?"</p>

<p>Franco brought the light and the letter, which
he handed to Uncle Piero. His grandmother had
written never a word, never a syllable; she had
simply returned the engineer's letter and Franco's
note. It was some time before the uncle could
grasp this. He was never quick to understand
things, and this thing was utterly incomprehensible
to him! When at last he did make it
out, he could not help saying: "Certainly this
is very hard!" Then, seeing how beside himself
Franco was, he added, with the big solemn voice
he used when judging human actions <i>toto corde</i>,
"Listen. It is, I should say&mdash;&mdash;" (and he
searched for the right word, in his own peculiar
fashion puffing out his cheeks, and emitting a sort
of rattling sound)"&mdash;&mdash;an injustice! But I am
by no means so extremely astonished as you are.
Not all the wrong is on her side, my dear fellow,
and so&mdash;&mdash;However, I am sorry for you two, who
will have to eat plain food and live in this miserable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
little town; but how about me? For my
part, I gain by all this, and I may even say, I
feel inclined to thank your grandmother. You
see I have never founded a family of my own; I
have always counted upon this family. Now my
poor sister is dead, and if your grandmother had
opened her arms to you, I should have been of no
more use than an old cabbage stock. So you
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Franco was careful not to let his wife know
about this matter, and although she was aware
that the letters had been sent to Cressogno, she
did not ask if his grandmother had answered, until
after the funeral, until some hours after the funeral.
The little drawing-room, the little terrace,
the little kitchen, had been full of people all day
long, from nine o'clock in the morning until nine
in the evening. At ten Luisa and Franco left
the house without a lantern, turned to the right,
went very slowly and silently through the darkness
of the village, and, passing the bright and
windy turning to which rises the deep roar of the
river of S. Mametti, stood among the shadows
and the pungent odours of the walnut-trees of
Looch. Shortly before they reached the cemetery,
Luisa said softly to her husband: "Have
you heard nothing from Cressogno?" He would
have liked to hide at least part of the truth from
her, but he could not. He said his note had been
returned to him; and then Luisa wanted to know
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
if his grandmother had sent a word of condolence
to Uncle Piero. Franco's "no" was almost timid,
and so uncertain that, after they had gone on a
few steps a suspicion flashed across Luisa's
mind, and she suddenly stopped, and seized her
husband's arm. Before she had uttered a word
Franco understood and embraced her as he had
embraced Uncle Piero, only still more impetuously,
telling her to take his heart, his soul, his
life, to seek for nothing else in this world. He
felt she was trembling violently in his arms, but
neither then nor afterwards did a word on this
subject pass between them. At the gate of the
cemetery they knelt together. Franco prayed
with the fervour of faith. Luisa, with eager eyes,
pierced the earth where it had been disturbed
near the entrance; pierced the coffin, and, in
thought, fixed her gaze on her mother's mild and
serious face; once more, in thought, but with an
impulse so violent that the bars of the gate shook,
she bent forward, lower and lower, pressed her
lips to the lips of the dead woman, imprinting
upon them a violence of affection, stronger than
all the insults, than all the baseness of this world.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock she tore herself reluctantly
away from the spot. Going slowly
down the slippery and stony path beside her
husband there suddenly arose before her mind's
eye a vision of a future meeting with the Marchesa.
She stopped, drawing herself up and
clenching her fists, and from her handsome, intelligent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
face there shone forth such fierceness
that, could the old lady of marble have seen her
thus, have met her at that moment, she might
not have surrendered, perhaps, but she would
certainly have hastened to put herself on the
defensive.</p>

<h1>Part Second</h1>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
FISHERMEN</h2>

<p>Dr. Francesco Zérboli, Imperial and
Royal Commissary of Porlezza, landed at
the Imperial and Royal <i>Ricevitoria</i>&mdash;the custom-house&mdash;at
Oria, on the tenth day of September,
1854, just as a truly imperial and royal sun was
rising above the ponderous bastions of Galbiga,
glorifying the little pink custom-house and the
oleanders and beans of Signora Peppina Bianconi,
and summoning to his office, in accordance with
the regulations, Signor Carlo Bianconi, her husband,
that same Receiver of Customs who had
scented conspiracy in manuscript music. Bianconi,
whom his wife called <i>el mè Carlascia</i>,&mdash;"my
big Charley"&mdash;and the people, <i>el Biancon</i>,
a tall man, fat and solid, with a clean-shaven
chin, a grey moustache, and the large dull eyes
of a faithful mastiff, went down to meet that other
clean-shaven Imperial and Royal one, of higher
rank. There was no resemblance between the
two, save in the Austrian nudity of their chins.
Zérboli, dressed in black and carefully gloved,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was short and stout, and wore a pair of fair
moustaches flattened against his sallow face, out
of which peered two small, sarcastic, and scornful
sparks of eyes. His hair grew so low on his forehead
that he was in the habit of shaving off a
strip, and at times a shade showed there, that gave
him the appearance of some strange beast. Quick
in his movements, in his glance, in his speech, he
spoke, with easy courtesy, a nasal Italian, having
the modulations of the province of Trento. He
now informed the Receiver that he had come to
hold a <i>convocato</i>&mdash;the communal council of those
days&mdash;at Castello, and that he had preferred to
come early and climb the hill while it was cool,
from Oria rather than from Casarico or Albogasio,
that he might have the pleasure of greeting the
Receiver.</p>

<p>The big, faithful mastiff did not at once understand
that the Commissary had a second end in
view, and poured forth his thanks in a medley of
obsequious phrases, and short, silly laughs,
rubbing his hands and offering coffee, milk, eggs,
and the open air of the little garden. The other
accepted the coffee, but declined the open air
with a motion of his head and a wink so eloquent,
that Carlascia, after shouting upstairs, "Peppina!"
ushered him into the office where, feeling himself
transformed (such was his double nature) from
a receiver of customs into a police-officer, he composed
himself, and put on an expression of austerity,
as if about to enter into a sacramental
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
union with the monarch himself. This office was
a miserable hole on the ground floor, with iron
gratings at the two small windows; an infectious
and primitive cell, that already stunk of the great
empire. The Commissary seated himself in the
middle of the room, looking at the closed door
that led from the landing-stage to the ante-room,
the one leading from the ante-room to the office
having been left open by his orders.</p>

<p>"Tell me something of Signor Maironi," said he.</p>

<p>"He is still watched," Bianconi answered, and
continued in the Italian of Porta Tosa. "By the
way&mdash;wait a moment&mdash;I have a report here that is
nearly finished." And he began hunting and
fumbling among his papers, in search of the report
and of his glasses.</p>

<p>"You will send it in, you will send it in!" exclaimed
the Commissary, who had a dread of the
big mastiff's prose.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile speak. Tell me everything."</p>

<p>"He is as ill-intentioned as ever. We knew
before he was ill-intentioned, but now it is very
evident," the eloquent Receiver continued. "He
has begun to wear that beard&mdash;you know&mdash;that
midget&mdash;that <i>moschetta</i>&mdash;that pointed tuft, that
filthy&mdash;&mdash;"<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the Commissary, "you see
I am new to the place. I have my instructions
and I have received some information, but as yet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
I have no exact knowledge of the man and his
family. You must describe them to me as
minutely as you can. Let us begin with him."</p>

<p>"He is a proud man, violent and overbearing.
He has quarrelled here at least fifty times over
questions of duty. He will never give in, and he
wants to teach me and the guard also. His eyes
flash as if he were going to eat the custom-house.
But it is no use being overbearing with me, even
if he&mdash;&mdash;For indeed he knows almost everything,
and that is a fact! He knows law, finance, music,
flowers, fish, and the devil knows what all else."</p>

<p>"And she?"</p>

<p>"She? Oh, she is a sly puss, but when she
shows her claws they are worse than his; much
worse! When he is angry he turns red and makes
a great row, she turns pale and is devilish insolent.
Of course I never tolerate her insolence, but&mdash;well,
you understand. She is a talented woman,
I can tell you. My Peppina is devoted to her.
She is a woman who makes friends everywhere.
Here in Oria they often send for her instead of
sending for the doctor. If there is a quarrel in a
family, they send for her. If an animal has the
stomach-ache, she must come. All the children
run after her, and she even makes little dolls for
them at Carnival time. You know, those little
puppets. Moreover this woman can play on the
spinet, and knows French and German. I am
so unfortunate as not to speak German, so I
have been to her several times to get German
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
documents explained, when such come to the
office."</p>

<p>"Ah! So you go to the Maironis' house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes, for that purpose."</p>

<p>In truth the big mastiff also went there to get
Franco to explain certain enigmatical passages in
the customs-tariff to him, but he did not say so.</p>

<p>The Commissary continued his examination.</p>

<p>"And how is the house furnished?"</p>

<p>"Well, very well. Fine Venetian floorings,
painted ceilings, sofas heavily draped, a spinet, a
splendid dining-room all hung with portraits."</p>

<p>"And the Engineer-in-Chief?"</p>

<p>"The engineer is a jolly, old-fashioned, kind
man; he resembles me, though he is older. But
he is not here much. He comes for two weeks
about this time of the year, and two weeks more
in the Spring, and he pays a few short visits in
between. Just leave him alone, and let him have
his milk in the morning, his milk at night, his
flask of Modena for dinner, his game of <i>tarocchi</i>,
and his <i>Milan Gazette</i>, and Engineer Ribera is
perfectly happy. But to return to Signor Maironi's
beard. There is something even worse!
I discovered yesterday that the gentleman has
planted a jasmine in a wooden box painted red!"<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>The Commissary, a man of parts, and probably
in his secret heart, indifferent to all colours save
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
that of his own complexion and his own tongue,
could not refrain from slightly shrugging his
shoulders. Nevertheless, he presently asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is the plant in blossom?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I will ask the woman."</p>

<p>"Ask whom? Your wife? So your wife goes
to Casa Maironi also?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from time to time."</p>

<p>Zérboli fixed his two little scornful eyes on
Bianconi's face, and put the following question,
enunciating every syllable very distinctly.</p>

<p>"Does she, or does she not, go there from good
motives?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to that, it depends! She imagines
she goes as a friend of Luisina's, to talk about the
flowers, their sewing, and for little bits of gossip,
and they chatter and chirp away as women will;
you know the way. But I get out of her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Tè chì, tè chì!</i> Behold, behold!" Signora
Peppina Bianconi exclaimed in her Porta Ticinese
dialect, as she came forward with the coffee,
smiling pleasantly. "The Commissary! What a
pleasure it is to see you! I am afraid the coffee
isn't very good, but any way it is fresh made. It
is a great nuisance not being able to have it from
Lugano!"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut!" grumbled her husband crossly.</p>

<p>"Well, what harm is that? I only said so in
fun. You understood, didn't you, <i>Sür Commissari</i>?
That blessed man there never understands
anything. I never get any coffee for myself,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
anyway. I am taking mallow-water now
for a dizzy head."</p>

<p>"Don't talk so much, don't talk so much!" her
husband interpolated, and the Commissary, setting
down the empty cup, told the good woman
that he was coming to see her flowers presently,
and this gallantry was like the act of one who, at
a café, throws the money upon the tray, that the
waiter may take it and be gone.</p>

<p>Signora Peppina understood, and awed by the
ferocious eyes of her Carlascia, withdrew in haste.</p>

<p>"Listen, listen, listen," the Commissary exclaimed,
covering his brow with his left hand, and
pressing his temples. "Oh!" he ejaculated, suddenly
remembering, "I have it! I wanted to
inquire if Engineer Ribera is in Oria at present."</p>

<p>"He is not here now, but I believe he is coming
very shortly."</p>

<p>"Does Engineer Ribera spend much money on
this Maironi family?"</p>

<p>"He certainly must spend a great deal. I
don't believe Don Franco has more than three
<i>svanziche</i> a day of his own, and she&mdash;&mdash;" The
Receiver blew across the palm of his hand. "So
you see&mdash;&mdash;! They keep a servant. They have
a little girl about two years old, and so they must
needs keep a maid to look after the child. They
send away for flowers, books, music, and all sorts
of things. Of an evening they play cards, and
there is always a bottle of wine. It takes a good
many <i>svanziche</i> to live in this way, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
    The Commissary reflected a moment with a
clouded brow, and eyes rolled up to the ceiling, and
then, in short, disjointed sentences that sounded
like fragments of an oracle, he let it be understood
that Engineer Ribera, an Imperial and Royal
official, recently favoured by the Imperial and
Royal government with a promotion <i>in loco</i>, should
exert a better influence over his nephew's family.
Then with further questionings and further observations
touching the engineer's present weaknesses,
he intimated to Bianconi that his paternal
attention should be directed with special secrecy
and delicacy towards their Imperial and Royal
colleague, in order that&mdash;should this become
necessary&mdash;they might be able to enlighten their
Superiors concerning certain acts of tolerance
which would be scandalous. He ended by inquiring
if Bianconi was aware that the lawyer
V. from Varenna and another individual from
Loveno were in the habit of visiting the Maironis
quite often. The Receiver knew this, and had
learned from his Peppina that they came to make
music. "I don't believe it," the Commissary
announced, with sudden and unusual asperity.
"Your wife does not understand at all. If you
go on like this, my dear Bianconi, they will lead
you by the nose. Those two are a couple of
rascals, who would be better off at Kufstein.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
You must seek for more information, and when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
you have obtained it, you will pass it on to me.
And now let us go into the garden. By the way,
when anything comes from Lugano for the Marchesa
Maironi&mdash;&mdash;" Zérboli finished the sentence
with a gesture of amiable munificence, and started
forward, followed by the deeply mortified mastiff.</p>

<p>Signora Peppina allowed them to find her in
the garden watering the flowers aided by a small
boy. The Commissary looked, admired, and
found a means of giving the subaltern police-officer
a little lesson. By praising her flowers he
easily led Signora Bianconi to mention Franco,
but, as if quite indifferent to that gentleman, he
did not dwell a moment upon him, but stuck
to the flowers, declaring that Maironi could not
possibly have finer ones. Little cries, groans, and
ejaculations broke from the humble Signora
Peppina, who was really embarrassed by such a
comparison. But the Commissary insisted. How?
Even the Casa Maironi fuchsias were finer? The
heliotrope and the <i>pelargonia</i> also? How about
the jasmine?</p>

<p>"The jasmine!" Signora Peppina exclaimed.
"Why, Signor Maironi has the finest jasmine in
the whole Valsolda, my dear sir!"</p>

<p>Thus, in the most natural way possible, did the
Commissary presently discover that the famous
jasmine had not yet blossomed. "I should like to
see Don Franco's dahlias," said he. The ingenuous
creature offered to accompany him to
Casa Ribera that very day. "They will be so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
delighted!" But the Commissary expressed his
desire to wait the coming of the Imperial and
Royal Engineer-in-Chief, that he might have an
opportunity of greeting him, whereupon Signora
Peppina said approvingly: "That is right." Meanwhile
the mastiff, humiliated by that superior
skill, and wishing to show in some way that, at
least, he was zealous, seized the boy with the
watering-pot by the arm, and presented him:</p>

<p>"My nephew. Son of a sister of mine, married
to an Imperial and Royal doorkeeper, at the
police station in Bergamo. He has the honour
to bear the names, <i>Francesco Giuseppe</i>&mdash;Francis
Joseph&mdash;bestowed upon him by my express desire.
Of course, you see, it would not be respectful to
use these names ordinarily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His mother calls him Ratì, and his father calls
him Ratù, fancy that!" Aunt Peppina put in.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" said his uncle. "I call him Francesco.
He is a well-behaved boy, I must say; a
very well-behaved boy. Now tell us, Francesco,
what are you going to do when you are a
man?"</p>

<p>Ratì rattled off his answer as if he were reciting
his catechism.</p>

<p>"When I am a man I shall always comport
myself as behooves a faithful and devoted subject
of His Majesty our Emperor, and a good Christian;
and I hope, with the help of the Lord, to become
some day, an Imperial and Royal Receiver of
Customs like my uncle, that I may, at last, enter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Paradise, and be duly rewarded for my virtuous
actions."</p>

<p>"Well done, well done, well done!" said Zérboli,
caressing Ratì. "Always walk in the path of
virtue."</p>

<p>"You be quiet, <i>Sür Commissari</i>," Peppina once
more burst out. "This morning the little villain
ate half the sugar out of the sugar-basin!"</p>

<p>"What, what, what?" Carlascia exclaimed,
forgetting his part in his astonishment. He remembered
himself at once however, and declared:
"It was your own fault. Things should be put
away. Is not that true, Francesco?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Ratì answered; and the Commissary
vexed at this wrangle, and at the twist his
paternal admonition had received, took himself
off without ceremony.</p>

<p>Hardly had he disappeared when Carlascia
scolded angrily: "You take the sugar again if you
dare, you!" and hit Francis Joseph a formidable
knock on the side of the head. This worthy had
expected quite different treatment, and ran off
to hide among the beans. Then Bianconi had it
out with his wife, scolding her roundly, and
swearing that in the future he would look after
the sugar himself; and upon her daring retort:
"What business is it of yours, after all?" he flung
out: "Everything is my business, everything is
my business!" and turning his back upon her,
strode off, puffing and tingling, to the spot where
his attentive wife had prepared the fishing-rod
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and the <i>polenta</i>, and began to bait the two great
hooks he used in catching tench. In the olden
days that little world was even more completely
isolated from the great world than at present, and
was, even more than at present, a world of silence
and of peace, in which the functionaries of both
State and Church, and, following their venerable
example, many faithful subjects as well, dedicated
several hours a day to edifying contemplation.
Seated first on the West, the Receiver cast two
hooks attached to a single line, two tempting
mouthfuls of <i>polenta</i>, as far out from the shore as
possible; when the line was stretched tight, when
the float seemed firmly anchored in quiet expectation,
the Imperial and Royal personage placed
the short rod delicately upon the low wall, and
sat down to contemplate. To the east of him
the <i>sedentario</i>, as the customs-guard was then
called, crouching on the humble landing-stage in
front of another float, smoked his pipe and contemplated.
A few steps beyond old, half-starved
Cüstant, a retired white-washer, sacristan and
churchwarden, one of the patricians of the village
of Oria, sat in contemplation, on the prow of his
boat, a lofty, prehistoric, tall hat on his head, the
magic wand in his hand, his legs dangling above the
water, and his soul concentrated on his own
particular float. Seated on the edge of a small
field, in the shade of a mulberry-tree and a large,
black, straw hat, the puny, thin, be-spectacled
Don Brazzova, parish-priest of Albogasio, was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
lost in contemplation, his image reflected in the
clear water. In a kitchen-garden of Albogasio
Inferiore, between the banks of the Ceron and that
of Mandroeugn, another patrician in a jacket and
high boots, the churchwarden Bignetta, called
<i>el Signoron</i>, the <i>fine gentleman</i>, sitting stiff and
solemn, upon an eighteenth century chair, with
the famous rod in his hand, watched and contemplated.
Under the fig-tree at Cadate, Don
Giuseppe Costabarbieri sat in contemplation. At
S. Mamette the doctor, the grocer, and the shoemaker
were hanging over the water and contemplating
most diligently. At Cressogno the Marchesa's
florid cook was contemplating. Opposite Oria,
on the shady deserted shore of Bisgnago, a
dignified arch-priest from lower Lombardy was
in the habit of leading a life of contemplation for
forty days every year. All alone he sat, with
three rods resting at his feet, while with the air
of a bishop, he contemplated the three floats
belonging to these rods&mdash;two with his eyes, one
with his nose. If some one, passing far out on
the lake could have seen all these brooding figures
without perceiving the rods, the lines, and the
floats, he would have thought himself in a country
inhabited by hermits and ascetics, who, weary of
the earth, were contemplating the sky in this
liquid mirror, simply for the sake of greater
convenience.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, all these ascetics were fishing
for tench, and no mystery the future of humanity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
might contain could be of more importance to
them than those mysteries at which the little
float secretly hinted, when, as if possessed by a
spirit, it showed signs of growing unrest, and, at
last, even of mental derangement; for, after
dipping and jerking, now forward, now backward,
it would at last, in the utter confusion of its ideas,
choose the desperate course of plunging head foremost
into the depths. These phenomena, however,
occurred only at rare intervals, and some
of the contemplators would pass whole half-days
without noticing the slightest movement in their
floats. Then each one, removing his eyes from
the bit of cork, would follow a line of thought
running parallel with the line attached to the rod.
Thus it sometimes happened that the arch-priest
would land an episcopal see, the "fine gentleman,"
a wood that had once belonged to his ancestors,
the cook, a tench from the hills, rosy and fair, and
Cüstant, an order from government to whitewash
the peak of Cressogno. As to Carlascia, his second
line was usually of a political nature, and the
reason of this will be more readily grasped if we
reflect that the main line, the one attached to the
rod, often awoke in his big, dull head certain
political considerations which the Commissary
Zérboli had suggested to him. "You see, my
dear Receiver," Zérboli had once said, when
discoursing weakly about the events which had
taken place on the sixth of February in Milan,
"you who fish for tench, can easily understand
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
this matter. Our great monarchy is fishing with
a line. The twin baits are Lombardy and the
Venetian provinces; two round and tempting
morsels, with iron inside. Our monarchy has
cast them there at its feet, opposite the lurking-place
of that foolish little fish, Piedmont. In
1848 it grabbed at the bait Lombardy, but eventually
succeeded in spitting it out and making
off. Milan is our float. When Milan moves, it
means that the little fish is just beneath. Last
year the float moved a wee bit, but the dear little
fish had only sniffed at the bait. But wait, some
day there will be a violent movement, and we
shall give a jerk; there will be some struggling,
some floundering, but we shall land our little
fish, and never let it escape again, the little white,
red, and green pig!"</p>

<p>Bianconi had laughed heartily at this, and
often when he sat down to fish, he would amuse
himself by ruminating on this graceful simile,
from which would generally arise other subtle and
profound political musings. That morning the
lake was quiet and most favourable to contemplation.
The tallest grass of the precipitous bottom
could be seen standing erect, a sign that
there was no under-current. The baited hook
cast far out, sunk straight and slowly, the line
stretched evenly and smoothly below the float
which sailed behind it a little way, surrounded by
a series of tiny rings, that told of the ticklings of
small carp, and then sunk into repose, a sign that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the bait was resting on the bottom, and that the
carp no longer worried it. The fisherman placed
the short rod on the low wall, and fell to thinking
of Engineer Ribera.</p>

<p>Though he was not aware of it Bianconi had a
large dose of meekness in one corner of his heart
which God, without informing him of it, had
made with a false bottom. The world had proof
of this in 1859, when the dear little fish, having
swallowed the bait Lombardy, with the hook,
the line, the rod, the Commissary, and everything
else, Bianconi took to planting national and constitutional
cabbages at Precotto. In spite of
this hidden meekness, as he now laid down his rod
and reflected that poor, old Engineer Ribera was
to be fished for, he experienced a singular satisfaction,
neither in his heart, nor his head, nor in
any of the usual senses, but in a particular sense
of his own, purely Imperial and Royal! Indeed
he had no consciousness of himself as distinct
from the Austrian governing organism. Receiver
at a small frontier customs-house, he considered
himself the point of the nail on a finger of
the state; then, as a police-agent, he considered
himself a microscopic eye under that nail. His
life was that of the monarchy. If the Russians
tickled the skin of Galicia, he felt the itching at
Oria. The greatness, the power, the glory of
Austria inflated him with unbounded pride. He
would not admit that Brazil was vaster than the
Austrian Empire, or that China was more thickly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
populated, or that the Archangel Michael could
take Peschiera, or the Almighty Himself take
Verona. His real Almighty was the Emperor;
he respected the One in Heaven as an ally of the
one at Vienna.</p>

<p>So, although he had never suspected that
Engineer Ribera was an unfaithful subject, the
Commissary's words&mdash;gospel truth to him&mdash;had
carried conviction with them, and the idea of
getting hold of this untrustworthy servant fired
the zeal of the royal eye and the imperial finger
nail. He called himself an ass for not having
seen through this man before. Oh, but there
was still time to catch him and hold him fast,
fast, fast! "You just leave it to me! Just
leave it to me, Signor Comm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly and seized the rod.
Gently, almost without moving, the float had
printed a ring on the water, the sign of a tench.
Bianconi clutched the rod tight, holding his
breath. Another dip of the float, another and
larger ring; the float moved slowly, slowly upon
the water, and then stopped. Bianconi's heart
was beating violently; the float moved still a
little further on the surface, and then went under;
zag! Bianconi gave a jerk, and the rod bowed
with the tugging on the line of a hidden fish.
"Peppina, I've got him!" shouted Carlascia,
losing his head. "The <i>guadèll</i>, the <i>guadèll</i>!" The
customs-guard turned round enviously: "Have
you got him, <i>Scior Recitòr</i>?" Cüstant, consumed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
with envy, gave no sign, not even turning his tall
hat. Ratì and Signora Peppina came rushing up,
the latter bringing the <i>guadèll</i>, a long pole with a
large net at the end of it, used for bagging the
tench in the water, for it would be a desperate
risk to lift it up by the line. Bianconi took the
line and began drawing it in very slowly. The
tench was not yet visible, but must surely be
enormous. The line came in smoothly for a few
feet, and then was jerked violently back; then it
began to come in again, nearer, ever nearer, until,
far down below the surface, underneath the very
noses of the three personages, something yellow
flashed, a monstrous shadow! "Oh, the beauty!"
said Signora Peppina under her breath. Ratì
exclaimed: "<i>Madone, Madone!</i>" But Bianconi
spoke never a word, and only pulled and pulled
cautiously. It was a fine, big fellow, short and
fat, with a dark back and a yellow belly, this fish
that was coming up from the depths, nearly exhausted
and moving crosswise with evident reluctance.</p>

<p>The three faces did not please the fish, for it
suddenly turned tail upon them, and once more
dived furiously towards the depths. At last,
however, completely exhausted, it followed the
line, and appeared at the foot of the wall, its gilded
belly uppermost. Signora Peppina, almost upside
down on the parapet, plunged her rod as far
as it would go, seeking in vain to bag the unhappy
fish. "By the head!" shouted her husband.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
"By the tail!" piped Ratì. At the noise, at
sight of that terrible net, the fish struggled and
dived. Peppina worked harder than ever, but
could find neither head nor tail. Bianconi pulled
and the tench rose to the surface once more, coiled
itself up, and with a mighty jerk, snapped the line,
and shot off amid the foam. "<i>Madone!</i>" exclaimed
Ratì, while Peppina continued to hunt
about in the water with her rod. "Where is
that fish? Where is that fish?" Bianconi, who
had sat as one petrified, still grasping the line,
now faced about in a rage; he kicked Ratì, caught
his wife by the shoulder, and shook her like a bag
of nuts, loading her with reproaches. "Has it
made off, <i>Scior Recitòr</i>?" asked the customs-guard
mellifluously. Cüstant turned his tall hat
just a little, glanced towards the scene of the
disaster, and then, returning to the contemplation
of his own placid float, mumbled in an indulgent
tone: "<i>Minga pratich!</i> Not skillful!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tench had returned to its native
grass-grown depths, melancholy but free, like
Piedmont after Novara. It is, however, doubtful
if the poor Engineer-in-Chief will be equally
fortunate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
THE MOONSHINE AND CLOUD SONATA</h2>

<p>The sun was sinking behind the brow of
Monte Brè and darkness was rapidly covering
the precipitous shores and the houses of Oria,
stamping the purple and gloomy profile of the hill
on the luminous green of the waves, which were
running obliquely towards the west, still high,
but foamless in the tired <i>breva</i>. The lights in
Casa Ribera had been the last to go out. Standing
against the steep vineyards of the mountainside
dotted with olives, it spanned the narrow
road that follows the coast-line, its modest façade
rising from the clear water, and flanked on the
west, towards the village, by a little hanging-garden,
divided into two tiers, on the east, towards
the church, by a small terrace raised on pillars,
which framed a square of church ground. In
this façade there was a small boathouse where
at that time the boat belonging to Franco and
Luisa lay rocking on the jostling waves. Above
the boathouse a slender gallery united the hanging-garden
on the west and the terrace on the east, and
looked out upon the lake by means of three windows.
They called it a loggia, perhaps because
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
it really had been one in olden times. The old
house bore incrusted here and there several of
these venerable, fossil names, which had survived
through tradition, and represented, in their apparent
absurdity, the mysteries of the religion of
domestic walls. Behind the loggia was a spacious
hall, and there were two rooms more behind that.
On the west was the small dining-room, its walls
covered with little, illustrious, paper men, each
under his own glass and in his own frame, each
in a dignified attitude, like the illustrious in flesh
and blood, looking as if his colleagues did not
exist at all, and the world was gazing at him
alone. On the east was the alcove-room, where
next to her parents, in her own little bed, slept
Signorina Maria Maironi, born in August, 1852.</p>

<p>From the great rococo chests to the bed-rooms,
the kitchen cupboard, the black clock in the little
dining-room, the sofa in the loggia, with its brown
cover, sprinkled with red and yellow Turks; from
the straw-bottomed chairs to the armchairs with
disproportionately high arms, the furniture of the
house all belonged to the epoch of the illustrious
men, most of whom wore the wig and pigtail.
Even though it did appear to have just descended
from the garret, it seemed, nevertheless, to have
regained in the light and air of its new surroundings
certain lost habits of cleanliness, a decided interest
in life, and the dignity of old age. Thus a collection
of disused words might to-day be composed
by the breath of some aged and conservative
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
poet, and reflect his serene and graceful senility.
Under the mathematical and bureaucratic rule of
Uncle Piero, chairs and armchairs, tables large and
small, had lived in perfect symmetry, and the
privilege of immobility had been extended to the
very mats themselves. The only piece of furniture
which might have been called <i>movable</i>, was
a grey and blue cushion, an abortive mattress,
which the engineer, during his short visits at
Oria, carried with him when he moved from one
easy-chair to another. When he was absent the
caretaker respected all relics of him to such an
extent as never to dare touch them familiarly, or
dust the less visible parts. This caused the
housekeeper to fly into a rage, regularly, every
time they returned to Valsolda. The master,
vexed that a little dust should cause so much
scolding of a poor peasant, would reprimand her,
and suggest that she do the dusting herself; and
when the woman&mdash;by way of a scornful retort&mdash;would
demand, wrathfully, if she was to kill herself
with dusting the house every time they came,
he would answer good-naturedly: "If you kill
yourself once, that will be sufficient."</p>

<p>The cultivation of the little garden as well as of
a kitchen-garden he owned to the east of the
church grounds, he left entirely to the caprice of
the caretaker. Only once, two years before
Luisa's marriage, arriving at Oria at the beginning
of September, and finding six stalks of maize
growing on the second terrace of the little garden,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
did he allow himself to say to the man: "Look
here, my friend. Couldn't you really get along
without those six stalks of Indian corn?"</p>

<p>Those liberal poets, Franco and Luisa, had
breathed upon things and changed their aspect.
Franco's poetry was more ardent, fervid and
passionate; Luisa's more prudent. Thus Franco's
sentiments always flamed out in his eyes, his face,
his words, while Luisa's seldom burst into flames,
and only tinged the depths of her penetrating
glance, and her soft voice. Franco was conservative
only in matters of religion and art; he was
an ardent radical as far as the domestic walls
were concerned, always planning transformations
of ceilings, walls, floors, and drapery. Luisa began
by admiring his genius, but as nearly all the funds
came from her uncle, and there was little margin
for extraordinary undertakings, she persuaded
him, very gently and little by little, to leave the
walls, the ceilings, and the floors as they were, and
to study how best to arrange the furniture without
seeking to transform it. And she would make
suggestions without appearing to do so, letting
him believe the ideas were his own, for Franco
was jealous of the paternity of ideas, while
Luisa was quite indifferent to this sort of maternity.
Thus, together, they arranged the hall as a
music-room, drawing-room, and reading-room; the
loggia as a card-room, while the terrace was
sacred to coffee and contemplation. This small
terrace became in Franco's hands the lyric poem
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the house. It was very tiny and Luisa felt that
here a concession might be made, and an outlet
provided for her husband's enthusiasms. It was
then that the king of Valsoldian mulberry-trees
fell from his throne, the famous and ancient mulberry
of the churchyard, a tyrant that deprived
the terrace of the finest view. Franco freed himself
from this tyrant by pecuniary means; then
he designed and raised above the terrace an airy
context of slim rods and bars of iron which
formed three arches surmounted by a tiny cupola,
and over this he trained two graceful passion-flower
vines, that opened their great blue eyes
here and there, and fell on all sides in festoons and
garlands. A small round table and some iron
chairs served for coffee and contemplation. As
to the little hanging-garden, Luisa would have
been willing to put up even with maize, with that
tolerance of the superior mind which loves to
humour the ideas, the habits, the affections of
inferior minds. She felt a sort of respectful pity
for the horticultural ideals of the poor caretaker,
for that mixture of roughness and gentleness he
had in his heart, a great heart, capable of holding
at once, reseda and pumpkins, balsam and carrots.
But Franco, generous and religious though he
was, would not have tolerated a carrot or a
pumpkin in his garden for love of any neighbour.
All stupid vulgarity irritated him. When the
unfortunate kitchen-gardener heard Don Franco
declare that the little garden was a filthy hole,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that everything must be torn up, everything
thrown away, he was so dazed and humiliated as
to excite pity; but when, working under his master's
orders, tracing out paths, bordering them
with tufa-stones, planting flowers and shrubs, he
saw how skilful Franco himself was with his hands,
and how many terrible Latin names he knew, and
what a surprising talent he possessed for imagining
new and beautiful arrangements, he conceived,
little by little, an almost fearful admiration for
him, which soon&mdash;in spite of many scoldings&mdash;developed
into devoted affection.</p>

<p>The little hanging garden was transformed in
Franco's own image and likeness. An <i>olea fragrans</i>
in one corner spoke of the power of gentle
things over the hot, impetuous spirit of the poet;
a tiny cypress, not over-acceptable to Luisa,
spoke in another corner of his religiosity; a low,
brick parapet, in open-work pattern, ran between
the cypress and the <i>olea</i>, supporting two parallel
rows of tufa-stones, between which blossomed a
smiling colony of verbenas, petunias, and wall-flowers,
and spoke of the singular ingenuity of
its author; the many rose-bushes scattered everywhere
spoke of his love of classic beauty; the
<i>ficus repens</i> which decked the walls towards the
lake, the twin orange-trees between the two tiers,
and a vigorous carob-tree, revealed a chilly temperament,
a fancy turning always towards the
south, insensible to the fascination of the north.</p>

<p>Luisa had worked far harder than her husband,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and still continued to do so, but whereas he was
proud of his labours and glad to speak of them,
Luisa, on the contrary, never mentioned hers, nor
was she in the least proud of them. She laboured
with the needle, the crochet, the iron, the scissors,
with a wonderful, calm rapidity; working for
her husband, her child, the poor, herself, and for
the adornment of her house. Each room contained
some creation of hers; dainty curtains, rugs,
cushions, or lamp-shades. It was also her duty
to arrange the flowers in the hall and the loggia;
no flowers in pots, for Franco did not have many,
and did not wish them shut up in rooms; no
flowers from the little garden, for to gather one
of those was like tearing it out of Franco's heart.
But the dahlias, the gladioles, the roses, and the
asters of the kitchen-garden were at Luisa's disposal.
These, however, were not sufficient, and
as the village loved "Sciora Luisa" best after the
Almighty, St. Margherita, and St. Sebastian, at
a sign from her, its children would bring her wildflowers
and ferns, and ivy to festoon between the
great bunches, stuck in metal rings on the walls.
Even the arms of the harp that hung from the
ceiling of the hall, were always entwined with
long serpents of ivy and passion-flower.</p>

<p>If they wrote to Uncle Piero of these innovations
he would answer little or nothing. At most he
would caution them not to keep the kitchen-gardener
too busy, but to leave him time for his
own work. The first time he came to Oria after
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the transformation of the little garden he paused
and contemplated it as he had contemplated the
six stocks of maize, and murmured under his
breath: "Oh dear me!" He went out to the
terrace, looked at the little cupola, touched the
iron bars, and pronounced an "Enough!" that
was resigned, but full of disapproval of so much
elegance, which he considered above the position
of his family and himself. But when he had examined
in silence all the nosegays and bunches of
flowers, the pots and the festoons of the hall and
the loggia, he said, with his good-natured smile:
"Look here, Luisa! Don't you think it would be
better to keep a couple of sheep with all this
fodder?"</p>

<p>But the housekeeper was delighted that she no
longer need kill herself for dust and cobwebs, and
the kitchen-gardener was for ever praising the
wonderful works of "Signor Don Franco," so
that Uncle Piero himself soon began to grow
accustomed to the new aspect his house had assumed,
and to look without disapproval upon the
little cupola, which, indeed, afforded a most
grateful shade. At the end of two or three days
he asked who had made it, and he would sometimes
pause to examine the flowers in the garden,
to inquire the name of one or another. At the
end of eight or ten days, standing with little
Maria at the door leading from the hall to the garden,
he would ask her: "Who planted all those
beautiful flowers?" and teach her to answer:
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"Papa!" He exhibited his nephew's creations
to an employé of his who one day came to visit
him, and listened to his expressions of approval
with a fine assumption of indifference, but with
the greatest satisfaction. "Yes, yes, he is clever
enough." Indeed he ended by becoming one of
Franco's admirers, and would even listen, in the
course of conversation, to other projects of his.
And in Franco, admiration and gratitude were
growing for that great and generous bounty that
had vanquished conservative nature, and the old
aversion for elegance of every description; for
that same bounty that at all such opposition rose
silently and even higher behind the uncle's resistance,
until it surmounted all, covered all in a
broad wave of acquiescence, or at least with the
sacramental phrase: "However, <i>fate vobis</i>; do
as you like." One innovation only Uncle Piero
had not been willing to accept&mdash;the disappearance
of his old cushion. "Luisa," said he,
gingerly lifting the new, embroidered cushion from
the easy-chair, "Luisa, take this away." And
he would not be persuaded. "Will you take it
away?" When Luisa, smiling, brought him the
little abortive mattress he sat down upon it with
a satisfied, "That's it!" as if he were solemnly taking
possession of a lost throne.</p>

<p>At the present moment, while the violet dusk
was invading the green of the waves and running
along the coast from village to village, eclipsing,
one after another, the shining white houses, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
engineer was seated upon his throne holding
little Maria on his knees, while out on the terrace
Franco was watering the pots of pelargonia, his
heart and his face as full of affectionate satisfaction
as if he had been slaking the thirst of Ishmael
in the desert. Luisa was patiently untangling a
fishing-line belonging to her husband, a frightful
snarl of string, lead, silk, and hooks. She was
talking, meanwhile, with Professor Gilardoni, who
always had some philosophical snarl to untangle,
but who greatly preferred a discussion with
Franco, who always contradicted him, right or
wrong, believing him to possess an excellent heart,
but a confused head. Uncle Piero, his right knee
resting on his left, held the child on this elevation,
and for the hundredth time at least, was repeating
a little scrap of verse to her, with affected
slowness, and a slight distortion of the foreign
name&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proud shade of the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Missipipì&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As far as the seventh word the child would
listen, motionless and serious, with earnest eyes;
but when he reached "Missipipì," she would
burst out laughing, pound hard with her little legs,
and clap her tiny hands over the uncle's mouth,
who would also laugh merrily, and after a short
pause he would begin again, speaking slowly,
slowly, in the same approved tone:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proud shade of the river&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</div></div>

<p>The child did not resemble either father or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
mother; she had the eyes, the delicate features of
Grandmother Teresa. She exhibited a strange
impetuous tenderness for the old uncle, whom
she so seldom saw. Uncle Piero did not use sweet
words to her; indeed, when necessary, he would
even chide her gently, but he always brought her
toys, often took her out to walk, danced her upon
his knee, laughed with her, and repeated comic
verses to her&mdash;the one beginning with the "Missipipì,"
and that other, ending with the words:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Answered so promptly young Barucabà!</span>
</div></div>

<p>Who may this Barucabà have been, and what
had they been asking him? "<i>Toa Bà! Toa Bà!</i>
Barucabà again! Barucabà again!" and once
more the uncle would recite the poetic tale to the
child, but there is no one now to repeat it to me.</p>

<p>This is what Professor Gilardoni was discussing
in his timid, gentle voice with Luisa; the Professor,
grown just a little older, just a little more
bald, just a little more sallow. "Who knows,"
Luisa had said, "if Maria will resemble her grandmother
in soul as she does in face." The Professor replied
that it would indeed be a miracle
to find two such souls in the same family, and
separated by so short an interval of time. Then
wishing to explain to how rare a species he conceived
the grandmother's soul to have belonged,
he gave voice to the following tangle: "There
are souls," said he, "that openly deny a future
life, and live according to their opinions, solely
for the present life. Such are few in number.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Then there are souls that pretend to believe in
a future life, and live entirely for the present.
These are far more numerous. There are souls
that do not think about the future life, but live
so that they may not run too great a risk of losing
it if, after all, it should be found to exist. These
are more numerous still. Then there are souls
that really do believe in the future life, and divide
their thoughts and actions into two categories,
which are generally at war with each other; one
is for heaven, the other for earth. There are very
many such. And then there are souls that live
entirely for the future life, in which they believe.
These are very few, and Signora Teresa was one
of them."</p>

<p>Franco, who hated psychological disquisitions,
passed frowning, with his empty watering-pot,
on his way to the little garden, and thought:
"Then there are those souls that are bores!"
Uncle Piero who, by the way, was slightly deaf,
was laughing with Maria. When her husband had
passed, Luisa said softly: "Then there are souls
that live as if there were only the future life, in
which they do not believe. And of such there
is one." The Professor started, and looked at her
in silence. She was hunting in the tangle of the
line for a double thread with a ring that must be
drawn through, and though she did not see his
glance, still she felt it, and quickly nodded towards
her uncle. Had she really been thinking of him
when speaking those words? Or had there been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
in her some occult complication? Had she alluded
to her uncle without conviction, simply
because she dare not name, even in thought, another
person to whom her words might more
justly apply? The Professor's silence, his searching
glance which she had felt without meeting,
revealed to her that he suspected her. It was for
that reason she had hastily nodded towards
Uncle Piero.</p>

<p>"Does he not believe in a future life?" the
Professor asked.</p>

<p>"I should say not," Luisa answered, and then at
once her heart was filled with remorse, for she
felt that her reasons for affirming this were not
sufficient, that she had no right to answer thus.
In fact her uncle had never taken the trouble to
meditate on religion. In his conception of honesty
were included the continuation of the ancient,
family practices and the profession of the inherited
faith, accepted carelessly, as it stood.
His was a good-natured God like himself, who,
again like himself, cared little for genuflections
and rosaries; a God well pleased to have honest,
hearty men for His ministers, as Uncle Piero was
well pleased to have such for his friends, even
though they might be merry eaters and drinkers,
life-long devotees of <i>tarocchi</i>, open tellers of spicy
but not filthy stories, as a lawful outlet for that
prurient hilarity which is in all of us. Certain
joking remarks of his, certain aphorisms uttered
thoughtlessly upon the relative importance of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
religious practices and the absolute importance
of honest living, had struck her, even as a child,
especially as they greatly vexed Signora Teresa,
who would entreat her brother not to "talk
nonsense." She suspected that he went to church
simply because it was fitting to do so. Perhaps
this was not true; one must overlook the aphorisms
of a man who had grown old in self-sacrifice
and self-abnegation, and who was wont to say:
<i>Charitas incipit a me.</i> Besides, even if her
uncle did hold religious practices in slight esteem,
there was a vast difference between that and
denying a future life. Indeed, as soon as Luisa
had uttered her opinion and had heard how it
sounded, she felt it was false, saw more clearly
within herself and realised that she had been
seeking in her uncle's example, a prop and a
comfort for herself.</p>

<p>The Professor was greatly moved by this
unexpected revelation.</p>

<p>"This one soul," said he, "that lives as if thinking
only of a future life in which it does not
believe, is indeed in error, but nevertheless, we are
bound to admire it as the most noble, the greatest
of all. It is something sublime!"</p>

<p>"But are you then sure that this soul is in
error?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"And you yourself, to which category do you
belong?"</p>

<p>The Professor really believed he was of the few
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
who rule their actions entirely according to an
aspiration towards a future life, but he would
have been embarrassed had he been called upon
to demonstrate that his earnest study of Raspail,
his zeal in the preparation of sedative water and
camphor cigarettes, his horror of dampness and of
draughts, were proofs of slight attachment to the
present life. However, he would not answer, but
said that though he did not belong to any church,
he nevertheless, believed firmly in God and the
future life, and that he could not judge of his own
conduct.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Franco, watering the little garden,
had discovered that a new verbena had blossomed,
and setting down his watering-pot, had
come to the door of the loggia and was calling to
Maria, to whom he wished to point it out. Maria
let him call, and demanded "Missipipì" again,
whereupon the uncle put her down, and himself
led her to her father.</p>

<p>"But, Professor," Luisa said, emerging by
means of the living word from a course of occult
ponderings, "do you not think one may believe
in God and still be in doubt concerning the future
life?"</p>

<p>Speaking thus she had dropped the tangled maze
of net, and was looking the Professor straight in
the face, with an expression of lively interest, and
a manifest desire that he might answer yes. As
Gilardoni did not speak she added&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me some one might say: What
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
obligation is God under to give us immortality?
The immortality of the soul is an invention of
human selfishness, which, after all, simply wishes
to make God serve its own convenience. We
want a reward for the good we do to others, and a
punishment for the evil others do to us. Let us
rather resign ourselves to complete death, which
comes to every living thing, being just with ourselves
and with others as long as we live, without
looking for future reward, but simply because God
wishes it, as he wishes every star to give light, and
every tree to give shade. What do you think
about it?"</p>

<p>"What can I say?" Gilardoni answered. "It
seems to me a thought of great beauty! I cannot
say: a great truth. Indeed I do not know.
I have never thought about it, but it is very
beautiful! I will say that Christianity has never
had, has never even imagined a Saint so sublime
as this <i>some one</i>! It is very beautiful, very
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"And besides," Luisa continued after a short
silence, "it might also be maintained that this
future would not mean perfect happiness. Can
there be happiness if we do not know the reasons
of all things? If we may not explain all mysteries?
And will this longing to know all things
be satisfied in the future life? Will there not
always remain one impenetrable mystery? Do
they not teach us that we shall never understand
God perfectly? Therefore, in our longing to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
know, shall we not end by suffering as at present,
perhaps even more, because in a higher life that
longing must become stronger? I can only see
one way of arriving at a knowledge of everything,
and that would be to become God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! You are a pantheist!" the Professor exclaimed,
interrupting her.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Luisa. "No, no, no, I am a
Catholic Christian. I am only repeating what
others might say."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but there is a pantheism&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Philosophy still?" exclaimed Franco, coming
in with the little one in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, misery!" grumbled Uncle Piero behind
him.</p>

<p>Maria held a beautiful white rose in her hand.
"Look at this rose, Luisa," said Franco. "Maria,
give Mamma the flower. Look at the shape of
this rose, its pose, its shading, the veins in its
petals; look at that red stripe, and inhale its
perfume. Now drop philosophy."</p>

<p>"You are an enemy of philosophy?" the Professor
said, smiling.</p>

<p>"I am a friend of that simple and sure philosophy
which even roses can teach me," Franco
answered.</p>

<p>"Philosophy, my dear Professor," Uncle Piero
put in solemnly, "is all contained in Aristotle.
You can get all you want from that source."</p>

<p>"You are jesting," the Professor said, "but you
yourself are a philosopher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
    The engineer placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Listen, dear friend! My philosophy could all
be put into eight or ten glasses."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! Eight or ten glasses!" grumbled
the housekeeper, who had caught her most temperate
master's words of boastful intemperance,
as she came in. "Eight or ten fiddlesticks!"</p>

<p>She had come to announce Don Giuseppe Costabarbieri,
whose hollow but jolly voice was just
then heard in the hall, saying heartily, "<i>Deo
gratias</i>." Then the red and wrinkled face, the
lively eyes, and the grey hair of the gentle priest
appeared.</p>

<p>"We are discussing philosophy, Don Giuseppe,"
said Luisa when greetings had been exchanged.
"Come here and let us have your valuable opinion."</p>

<p>Don Guiseppe scratched his head, and then
turning it slightly towards the engineer, with the
expression of one who desires something for which
he hardly dares to ask, gave utterance to this
flower of his philosophical opinions.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't a little game of primero be better?"</p>

<p>Franco and Uncle Piero, who were only too glad
to escape from Gilardoni's philosophy, sat
merrily down to the little table with the priest.</p>

<p>As soon as he and Luisa were alone, the Professor
said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Marchesa left yesterday."</p>

<p>Luisa, who had taken Maria upon her lap,
pressed her lips to the child's neck passionately.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," continued Gilardoni, who had never
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
known how to read in the human heart, or to touch
its chords correctly, "perhaps sometime&mdash;it is
only three years, yet&mdash;perhaps the day may come
when she will yield."</p>

<p>Luisa raised her face from Maria's neck. "Perhaps
<i>she</i> may yield!" said she. The Professor
did not understand, and giving way to the evil
genius that invariably suggested to him the worst
word at the worst moment, he persisted instead
of breaking off. "Perhaps, if she could see Maria!"
Luisa pressed the little girl to her breast, and
looked at him so fiercely that he was confused, and
stammered, "I beg your pardon!" Maria, in
this close embrace, raised her eyes to her mother's
strange face, grew very red, pressed her lips tight
together, cried two great tears, and began to sob.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear!" Luisa murmured tenderly to
her, "be quiet, be quiet! You shall never see her,
never!"</p>

<p>As soon as the child was comforted the Professor,
distressed at the mistake he had made, at
having offended this Luisa, who seemed to him a
superhuman being, wished to explain, to justify
himself, but Luisa would not allow him to speak.
"Pardon me, but that will do," said she, rising.
"Let us go and watch the game."</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, she did not go near the
players. She sent Maria to amuse herself in the
church-grounds with her little nurse, Veronica,
and herself went to carry a piece of pudding to an
old villager who had a voracious appetite and a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
small voice, with which he would every day
promise his benefactress the same precious recompense,
"Before I die, I will give you a kiss."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Professor was filled with scruples
and remorse for the unfortunate step he had
taken. Not knowing whether to go or to remain,
whether the lady would or would not return,
whether it would or would not be indiscreet to go
in search of her, after having looked out towards
the lake as if seeking advice from the fishes, towards
the hills to see if she or some one of whom he
could inquire about her happened to be at one of
the windows, he finally went to watch the game.</p>

<p>Each one of the players kept his eyes fixed on
the four cards he held in his left hand, placed one
upon the other in such a way that the second and
third projected above the others just enough to be
recognisable, while the fourth remained carefully
hidden.</p>

<p>The Professor reflected that he also held a
secret card, a trump, and he was undecided
whether to play it or not. He held old Maironi's
will. A few days after Signora Teresa's death,
Franco had told him to destroy it, and never
breathe a word about it to Luisa. He had obeyed
only so far as keeping silence was concerned.
The document still existed, though of this Franco
was ignorant, because its custodian had determined
to await the development of events, to see
if Cressogno and Oria would come to terms, or if,
in consequence of prolonged hostilities, Franco
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and his family would be reduced to want, in which
case he himself intended to do something.
What he should do, he did not really know. He
was nurturing the germs of several foolish plans
in his head, and trusted that one or other of them
would have ripened before the time for action
arrived. Now, as he watched Franco play, he
wondered how that man, so engrossed in his desire
to win a pasteboard king, could ever have refused
that other precious card, not even wishing
to inform his wife of its existence. He attributed
this silence to modesty, to a desire to hide a
generous action, and although he had suffered
more than one sharp rebuff from him, and felt that
Franco esteemed him lightly, still he looked upon
him with a respect full of humble devotion.</p>

<p>"Give me the cards! Give me the cards!" the
priest exclaimed, and he shuffled them eagerly.
Then the game, symbol of the universal struggle
between the blacks and the reds, began once more.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The lake now lay sleeping, covered and encircled
by shadows. Only on the east the great,
distant mountains of the Lario were still in a
glory of purple and rich, yellow gold. The first
breath of the evening breeze out of the north,
moved the tender branches of the passion-flowers,
ruffled, in spots, the surface of the grey waters
towards the upper lake, and wafted a perfume
of cool woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
    When Luisa returned the Professor had been
gone some time.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is <i>Sciora</i> Luisa!" said Don Giuseppe,
who was feeling quite satisfied, having had his fill
of primero, and he gently stroked the modest
rotundity of his ribs and belly. Then this little
personage of the world of long ago remembered
the second object of his visit. He had wished to
speak a little word to Signora Luisa. The engineer
had gone out to take his usual short walk
as far as the Tavorell hill, which he jokingly called
the St. Bernard, and Franco, after a glance at
the moon which was just then sparkling above
the black brow of the Bisgnago, and below, in the
undulations of the water, began improvising on the
piano outpourings of ideal sorrow, that floated out
of the open windows upon the deep sonorousness of
the lake. His musical improvisations were more
successful than his elaborate poems because in music
his impulsive feelings found a mode of expression
more facile, more complete, and the scruples, the
uncertainties, the doubts which rendered the labour
of language most wearisome and slow, did not torment
his fancy at the piano. There he would
give himself up, body and soul, to the poetic
rage, and quivering to the roots of his hair, his
clear, speaking eyes reflecting every little shade
in the musical expression, while his face worked
with the continuous movement of inarticulate
words, his hands, though neither very agile nor
very supple, would make the piano sing ineffably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
    At the present moment he was passing from
one tone to another, breathing hard, and putting
all the strength of his intellect into those passages,
eviscerating the instrument, as it were, with his
ten fingers, and almost with his glowing eyes as
well. He had begun to play under the spell of
the moonshine, but as he played, sad clouds had
arisen from the depths of his heart. Conscious
that as a youth he had dreamed of glory and that
later he had humbly laid aside all hope of attaining
it, he said, almost to himself, with his sad and
passionate music, that in him there was indeed
some glow of genius, some of the fire of creation
seen only by God, for not even Luisa exhibited
that esteem for his intellect which he himself
lacked, but which he could have wished to find in
her; not even Luisa, the heart of his heart. She
praised his music and his poetry in measured
terms, but she had never said: "Follow this path,
dare, write, publish." He was thinking of this as
he played on in the dark hall putting into a tender
melody the lament of his love, the timid, secret
lament he would never have dared to put into
words.</p>

<p>Out on the terrace in the quivering light-and-shade
formed by the breath of the north wind and
the passion-flower vines, by the moon and its
reflection in the lake, Don Giuseppe was telling
Luisa that Signor Giacomo Puttini was angry
with him on account of Signora Pasotti, who had
repeated to him the false report that he, Don
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Giuseppe, was going about preaching the necessity
of a marriage between Puttini and Marianna.
"May I be struck dead," the poor priest protested,
"if I ever breathed a single word! Not a single
word! It is all a lie!" Luisa would not believe
poor Barborin guilty, but Don Giuseppe declared
he had it straight from the Controller himself.
Then she understood at once that the cunning
Pasotti was indulging in a joke at the expense of
his wife, Signor Giacomo, and the priest, and
declining to interfere in the matter as Don
Giuseppe wished her to do, she advised him to
speak to Signora Pasotti herself. "She is so
terribly deaf!" said the priest, scratching his
head; and he finally departed, dissatisfied, and
without saluting Franco, whom he did not wish to
interrupt. Luisa went towards the piano on tiptoe,
and stopped to listen to her husband, to hear
the beauty, the richness, the fire of that soul which
was hers, and to which she belonged for ever.
If she had never said to Franco, "Follow this
path, write, publish!" it was perhaps because in
her well-balanced affection she believed, and with
reason, that he would never be able to produce
anything superior to mediocrity, but it was above
all, because, although she had a fine feeling for
music and poetry, she did not really esteem either
of much account. She did not approve of a man's
dedicating himself wholly to either, and she had
an ardent longing that her husband's intellectual
and material activity should flow in a more manly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
channel. Nevertheless, she admired Franco in
his music more than if he had been a great master;
she found in this almost secret expression of his
soul something virginal, something sincere, the
light of a loving spirit, most worthy to be loved.</p>

<p>He did not perceive her presence until two arms
brushed his shoulders and he saw two little hands
hanging on his breast. "No! no! Play, play!"
Luisa murmured, for Franco had grasped the
hands; but, without answering, his head thrown
back, he sought her, sought her lips and her eyes,
and she kissed him and then raised her face,
repeating, "Play." He drew the imprisoned wrists
still farther down, silently praying for the sweet,
sweet mouth: then she surrendered, and pressed
her lips upon his in a long kiss, full of understanding,
and infinitely more exquisite, more exhilarating
than the first. Then she once more whispered,
"Play."</p>

<p>And in his happiness he played the music of
triumph, full of joy and of cries. For at that
moment it seemed to him he possessed the soul of
this woman in its entirety, whereas sometimes,
even though convinced that she loved him, he
seemed to feel in her that lofty reason, towering
serene and cold, above love itself, and far beyond
the reach of his enthusiasms. She would often
place her hands upon his head, and from time to
time kiss his hair softly. She was aware
of her husband's doubts, and always protested
that she was all his, but in her heart she knew he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
was right. There was in her a tenacious, fierce
sense of intellectual independence which withstood
love. She could judge her husband calmly,
recognising his imperfections, but she felt he was
not capable of doing the same, felt how humble
he was in his love, in his boundless devotion.
She did not think she was unjust to him, she felt
no remorse, but she was touched with loving pity
when she pondered these things. Now she guessed
the meaning of this joyous musical outpouring,
and, deeply moved, she embraced Franco and the
piano became suddenly silent.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Uncle Piero's slow, heavy step was heard on
the stairs; he was returning from his St. Bernard.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock, and the usual <i>tarocchi</i>-players,
Signors Giacomo and Pasotti, had not yet
arrived, for in September Pasotti himself became a
regular visitor at Casa Ribera, where he pretended
to be in love with the engineer, with Luisa, and even
with Franco. Franco and Luisa suspected some
duplicity, but Pasotti was an old friend of the
uncle's, and must be tolerated out of respect to
him. As the players failed to appear Franco proposed
to his wife that they should go out in the
boat to enjoy the moon. First, however, they
went to see Maria, who was asleep in her little
bed in the alcove, her head drooping towards her
right shoulder, one arm under her pillow, and the
other resting across her breast. They looked at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
her and kissed her smiling, and then the silent
thoughts of both flew to Grandmamma Teresa,
who would have loved her so dearly. With serious
faces, they kissed her once more. "My poor
little one!" said Franco. "Poor, penniless,
Donna Maria Maironi!"</p>

<p>Luisa placed her hand upon his mouth. "Be
quiet!" said she. "We are fortunate, we who
are the penniless Maironis."</p>

<p>Franco understood, and did not answer at once,
but presently, when they were leaving the room
to go to the boat, he said to his wife, forgetting one
of his grandmother's threats, "It will not always
be thus."</p>

<p>This allusion to the old Marchesa's wealth displeased
Luisa. "Do not speak of it to me," she
said. "I would not soil my fingers by touching
that money."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Maria," Franco observed.</p>

<p>"Maria has us. We can work."</p>

<p>Franco was silent. Work! That was one of
the words that chilled his heart. He knew he
was leading a life of indolence, for were not music,
books, flowers, and a few verses now and then,
merely vanities and a waste of time? And he was
leading this life almost entirely at the expense of
others, for how could he possibly have managed
with only his one thousand Austrian lire a year?
How could he have maintained his family? He had
taken his collegiate degree, but without deriving
the slightest profit from it. He doubted his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
ability, felt himself too much of an artist, too
foreign to forensic wiles, and he was well aware
that the blood of earnest labourers did not flow in
his veins. His only hope was in a revolution, a
war, in the freedom of his country. Ah! When
Italy should be free, how well he would serve her,
with what great strength, what joy! This poetry
he had indeed in his heart, but he lacked the
energy, the constancy to prepare himself by
study for such a future.</p>

<p>While he was rowing away from the shore in
silence, Luisa was wondering how it was that her
husband could pity the child because she was poor.
Did not this sentiment stand in contradiction to
Franco's faith, to his Christian piety? She recalled
Professor Gilardoni's categories. Franco
believed firmly in a future life, but in practice he
clung passionately to all that is beautiful and
good in this earthly life, clung to all its lawful
pleasures, including cards and dainty dinners.
One who obeyed the precepts of the Church so
scrupulously, who was so careful to abstain from
flesh on Fridays and Saturdays, to listen to a
sermon every Sunday, should conform his daily
life far more strictly to the evangelical ideal. He
should rather fear than desire riches.</p>

<p>"A pleasant sail to you!" Uncle Piero called
out from the terrace, catching sight of the boat
and Luisa seated in the prow in the moonlight.
Opposite black Bisgnago all Valsolda, from Niscioree
to Caravina lay spread out in the glory of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the moon; all the windows of Oria and of Albogasio,
the arches of Villa Pasotti, the tiny
white houses of the most distant villages, Castello,
Casarico, S. Mamette, Drano, seemed to be gazing
as if hypnotised, at the great, motionless eye of the
dead orb in the heavens.</p>

<p>Franco drew the oars into the boat. "Sing,"
said he.</p>

<p>Luisa had never studied singing, but she possessed
a sweet mezzo-soprano voice and a perfect
ear, and had learned many operatic airs from her
mother, who had heard Grisi, Pasta, and Malibran,
during the golden days of Italian opera.</p>

<p>She began the air from <i>Anne Boleyn</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Al dolce guidami<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castel natio.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song of the soul which at first descends,
little by little, and finally, in greater sweetness
gives itself up to its love, to rise again, locked in
his embrace, in an impulse of desire towards some
distant light which shall complete its happiness.
She sang, and Franco, carried away, fancied that
she longed to be united to him in that lofty region
of the soul from which she had, until now, excluded
him; that in this perfect union, she longed
to be guided by him towards the goal of his ideals.
A sob rose in his throat, and the rippling lake,
the great tragic mountains, those eyes of things
fixed upon the moon, the very light of the moon
itself, everything, was filled with his indefinable
sentiment. And so, when beyond the broken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
image of the orb, silver lights flashed for a moment
as far as Bisgnago, and even into the shadowy
gulf of the Doi, he was moved, as if they had been
mysterious signals concerning him, which lake
and moon were exchanging, while Luisa finished
the verse:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ai verdi platani,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Al cheto rio<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Che i nostri mormora<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sospi ancor.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Pasotti's voice called from the terrace&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Brava!</i>"</p>

<p>And Uncle Piero shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Tarocco!</i>"</p>

<p>At the same moment they heard the oars of a
boat coming from Porlezza, and a bassoon mimicked
the air of <i>Anne Boleyn</i>. Franco, who
had seated himself in the stern of his boat, started
to his feet, crying delightedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who goes there?" A fine, big, bass voice
answered him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Buona sera<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miei signori,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buona sera,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buona sera.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They were his friends from the Lake of Como,
the lawyer V. of Varenna and a certain Pedraglio
of Loveno, who were in the habit of coming to
make music openly, and discuss politics in secret;
this was known only to Luisa.</p>

<p>They called from the terrace&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
    "Well done, Don Basilio!&mdash;Bravo, bassoon!"
And in the interval the voice could be heard of
some one who was begging to be excused from
<i>tarocco</i>: "No, no, most gracious Controller, it is
late! The time is too short; really too short.
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Indeed you must excuse
me. I cannot, I cannot. Most worshipful Engineer,
I appeal to you!"</p>

<p>But they made the little man play, promising
that they would not go beyond two games. He
puffed very hard, and sat down to the little table
with the engineer, Pasotti, and Pedraglio. Franco
seated himself at the piano, and the lawyer
placed himself beside him with the bassoon.</p>

<p>Between Pasotti and Pedraglio, two terrible
quizzers, poor Signor Giacomo passed a short half-hour
which was full of tribulation. They did not
leave him alone a minute. "How goes it, <i>Scior
Zacomo</i>?&mdash;Badly, badly! <i>Scior Zacomo</i>, are there
no friars walking about in slippers?&mdash;Not one.
And the bull, how is the bull, <i>Scior Zacomo</i>?&mdash;Stop,
stop&mdash;A most accursed beast, eh?&mdash;Yes,
indeed, Sir. And the servant, <i>Scior Zacomo</i>?"
"Hush!" exclaimed Pasotti at this impertinent
question of Pedraglio's. "Be prudent. On this
point Signor Giacomo is having a great deal of
trouble, through the indiscretion of certain individuals."
"Let us not discuss it, most gracious
Controller, let us not discuss it!" Signor Giacomo
exclaimed, writhing all over, and the engineer
advised him to send his tormentors to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
devil. "But how is this, <i>Scior Zacomo</i>," Pasotti
went on, undaunted, "don't you call that little
priest indiscreet?" "I call him an ass!" Signor
Giacomo answered angrily. Then Pasotti, smiling
and triumphant, because this joke was really
of his own making, ordered Pedraglio to be quiet,
and started the game afresh, although Pedraglio
was bursting with curiosity to hear the story.</p>

<p>Franco and the lawyer were studying a
new composition for piano and bassoon, continually
making mistakes and beginning over again.
Presently Signora Bianconi came in on tiptoe
that she might not interrupt the melody. No
one noticed her entrance save Luisa, who
made her sit down beside her on the little sofa
near the piano.</p>

<p>Signora Peppina with her cordial good-nature,
her long tongue, and her foolishness was irritating
to Franco, but not to Luisa. Luisa liked her,
but she was careful on account of Carlascia. From
her garden Peppina had heard that "lovely song,"
and then the bassoon and the greetings; she had
imagined there was going to be music, and she was
"so madly fond of music, you know!" There
was that lawyer who "blows into that shiny
thing," to say nothing of Don Franco with those
fingers of his "that seem bewitched." To hear
the piano played with such precision was as good
as hearing a barrel-organ, and she was "so awfully
fond" of barrel-organs! She added that she had
been afraid she should disturb them, but that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
her husband had encouraged her to come. And
she asked if that other gentleman from Loveno
did not play also; if they were going to stay long;
and observed that both must be passionately fond
of music.</p>

<p>"I'll be even with you, you rascal of a Receiver,"
thought Luisa, and she proceeded to stuff his wife
with the most ridiculous tales of the melomania of
Pedraglio and the lawyer, inventing more and
more as she grew more and more angry with those
odious persons against whom one was obliged to
defend one's self by lying. Signora Peppina swallowed
all the stories scrupulously down to the
very last, accompanying them with gentle notes
of pleased wonder: "Oh, how strange!&mdash;Just
fancy!&mdash;Just think of that!" Then, instead of
listening to the diabolical dispute going on between
the piano and the bassoon, she began to talk of the
Commissary, saying he intended to come and see
Don Franco's flowers.</p>

<p>"He may come," said Luisa, coldly.</p>

<p>Then Signora Peppina, taking advantage of the
storm Franco and his friend were raising, risked a
little private speech, which would have cost her
dear had her Carlascia overheard it, but fortunately
that faithful mastiff was asleep in his
own bed, his night-cap drawn well down over his
ears.</p>

<p>"I am so devoted to these dear flowers!" she
began. It was her opinion the Maironis would
do well to pet the Commissary a little. He was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
one of the Marchesa's intimates, and it would be
awful if he should take it into his head to cause
them trouble. He was a terrible man, this Commissary!
"Now my Carlo barks a little, but he is
a good creature; the other one doesn't bark, but&mdash;you
understand?" She herself knew nothing
about it, had not heard anything, but if, for
example, that lawyer and the other gentleman
had come for something else than music, and the
Commissary should find it out&mdash;&mdash;! Then the
Lord have mercy on us!</p>

<p>The moon was dragging its splendour across the
lake towards the western waters; the game had
come to an end, and Signor Giacomo was preparing
to light his little lantern, in spite of Pasotti's
remonstrances. "A light, <i>Scior Zacomo</i>? You
are mad! A light with such a moon!" "At
your service," Puttini replied. "In the first
place there is that accursed Pomodoro to cross,
and then&mdash;<i>cossa vorla</i>&mdash;the moon nowadays!
Besides I must tell you it is the August moon, for
although we are in September, still the moon
belongs to August. Well, once upon a time, my
dear sirs, August moons were fine and big, as
large as the bottom of a cask at least; now they
are no better than moonlets, good-for-nothing
moons&mdash;&mdash;no, no, no." And his lantern lighted,
he departed with Pasotti, the impertinent Pedraglio
accompanying them as far as the gate of
the little garden, with his usual fire of antiphones
about the bull and the servant. Then the little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
man turned towards the cavernous streets of Oria,
greatly comforted by Pasotti's exclamations:
"Ill-bred people, <i>Scior Zacomo</i>! Vulgar people!"
exclamations uttered in a tone calculated to reach
the others, and add to their amusement.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A loud gape from the engineer put Signora
Peppina to flight. A few minutes later, having
drunk his cup of milk, Uncle Piero took leave of the
company in verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tall laurel trees and myrtle sweet upon Parnassus grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May night upon you, worthy Sirs, great happiness bestow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The two guests also asked for a little milk, but
Franco, who understood their Latin, went for an
old bottle of the wine from the small but excellent
vineyard of Mainé.</p>

<p>When he returned Uncle Piero was no longer
present. The dark, bearded lawyer, the picture
of strength and placidity, raised both hands
silently, summoning Luisa and Franco, one to
either side of him. Then he said softly, in his
voice like a violoncello, warm and deep&mdash;</p>

<p>"Great news!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Franco, opening his eager
eyes wide. Luisa turned pale, and clasped her
hands in silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Pedraglio calmly and
seriously, "we have succeeded!"</p>

<p>"Speak out! Speak out!" Franco begged.
The lawyer answered him:</p>

<p>"We have Piedmont allied with France and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
England! To-day war with Russia, to-morrow
with Austria! Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>With a sob Franco sprang to embrace his friends.</p>

<p>The three stood clinging to one another in
silence, pressing close in the intoxication of the
magic word: War! Franco forgot that he still
held the bottle. Luisa took it from him. Then
he tore himself impetuously from the other two,
rushed between them, and seizing each round the
waist, dragged them into the hall like an avalanche,
repeating: "Tell all, tell all, tell all!"</p>

<p>There, when they had prudently closed the
glass door leading to the terrace, the lawyer and
Pedraglio disclosed their precious secret. An
English lady, spending her holiday at Bellagio,
who was a devoted friend of Italy, had received
a letter (of which the lawyer possessed a translation)
from another lady, a cousin of Sir James
Hudson, English Minister at Turin. The letter
stated that secret negotiations were being carried
on in Turin, Paris, and London, to obtain the
armed co-operation of Piedmont in the Orient;
that the matter was looked upon as settled by the
three cabinets, but that there still remained a few
formal difficulties to arrange, as Count Cavour
demanded the greatest consideration for the
dignity of his country. At Turin they were
confident the official and open invitation from the
Western powers to accede to the treaty of the
tenth of April, 1851, would come to hand not
later than December. It was even affirmed that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the troops forming the contingent would be under
the command of the Duke of Genoa.</p>

<p>The lawyer read, and Franco held his wife's
hand tight. Then he wanted to read the letter
himself, and after him Luisa read. "But," said
she, "war with Austria? How is that?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," said the lawyer. "Do you
suppose Cavour is going to send the Duke of
Genoa with fifteen or twenty thousand men to
fight the Turks unless he already holds the war
with Austria in his hand? You may believe me,
Madam, it will come about before a year is
passed."</p>

<p>Franco shook his fists in the air, his whole body
quivering.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Cavour!" whispered Luisa.</p>

<p>"Ah!" the lawyer exclaimed, "Demosthenes
himself could not have praised Cavour with
greater efficacy."</p>

<p>Franco's eyes were filling with tears. "I am
a fool!" he said. "I don't know what to say!"</p>

<p>Pedraglio asked Luisa where the deuce she had
hidden the bottle. Luisa smiled and went out,
returning again immediately with the wine and
glasses.</p>

<p>"Count Cavour!" said Pedraglio in a low tone.
All raised their glasses repeating: "Count Cavour!"
Then they drank, even Luisa, who never
took wine.</p>

<p>Pedraglio refilled the glasses and again rose to
his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
    "War!" said he.</p>

<p>The three others sprang up, clutching their
glasses in silence, too deeply moved to speak.</p>

<p>"We must all go!" said Pedraglio.</p>

<p>"All!" Franco repeated. Luisa kissed him
impetuously on the shoulder. Her husband
seized her head in both hands, and imprinted a kiss
upon her hair.</p>

<p>One of the windows towards the lake was open.
In the silence that followed the kiss, they heard
the measured dip of oars.</p>

<p>"The customs-guards," whispered Franco.
While the guards' long-boat was passing beneath
the window, Pedraglio said: "D&mdash;&mdash; hogs!" in
such a loud tone, that the others hushed him.
The long-boat floated past. Franco looked out
of the window.</p>

<p>It was cool; the moon was sinking towards the
hills of Carona, streaking the lake with long,
gilded stripes. What a strange sensation it gave
him to contemplate that quiet solitude, with a
great war so near at hand! The dark, sad
mountains seemed to be thinking of the formidable
future. Franco closed the window, and the
conversation began again in low tones round the
little table. Each one had his own suppositions
concerning future events, and all spoke of these
events as of a drama, of which the manuscript
was lying quite ready, down to the very last verse,
with all its stops and commas in place, in Count
Cavour's writing-desk. V., who was a Bonapartist,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
saw clearly that Napoleon intended to
avenge his uncle, overthrowing one after another,
the parties to the Holy Alliance; to-day Russia,
to-morrow Austria. But Franco, on the other
hand, who was mistrustful of the emperor, attributed
the Sardinian alliance to the good-will of
England, but acknowledged that as soon as this
alliance would be proclaimed, Austria, sacrificing
her own interests to principles and hatred, would
cast in her lot with Russia, and therefore Napoleon
would be obliged to fight her. "Listen," said
his wife, "I am afraid Austria will come over to the
side of Piedmont," "Impossible!" said the lawyer.
Franco felt alarmed, and admired the
acuteness of the observation, but Pedraglio
exclaimed: "Nonsense! Those blockheads are too
great asses to think out a trick like that!" This
argument appeared decisive, and no one save
Luisa gave the possibility another thought. They
began discussing plans for the campaign, plans for
insurrections, but here they could not agree. V.
knew the men and the mountains of the Lake of
Como from Colico to Como and Lecco, better perhaps
than any one else. And everywhere all
along the lake, in Val Menaggio, in Vall 'Intelvi,
in Valsassina, in the Tre Pievi, he knew those who
were devoted to the cause, and even ready to
strike the blow at a sign from the <i>Scior Avocât</i>.
He and Franco considered any insurrectional
movement useful that might serve to distract part
of the Austrian forces even for a moment. But
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Luisa and Pedraglio were of opinion that all the
able-bodied men should hasten to swell the Piedmontese
battalions. "We women will make the
revolution," said Luisa, with her mock gravity.
"I, for my part, will pitch Carlascia into the
lake!"</p>

<p>They still conversed in an undertone, with an
electric current in their veins that flashed from
their eyes, and made their nerves tingle; enjoying
this hushed talk behind closed doors and windows,
the danger of being in possession of that letter,
the glowing life they felt in their blood, and those
intoxicating words they were always repeating:
Piedmont, War, Cavour, Duke of Genoa, Victor
Emmanuel, Cannon, <i>Bersaglieri</i>.</p>

<p>"Do you know what time it is?" said Pedraglio,
consulting his watch. "It is half-past twelve!
Let us go to bed."</p>

<p>Luisa went for the candles, and lighted them,
standing the while, but no one moved, so she also
sat down again. When he saw the candles lighted,
even Pedraglio himself lost his desire to go to
bed.</p>

<p>"A fine kingdom!" said he.</p>

<p>"Piedmont," said Franco, "Lombardy-Venice,
Parma, and Modena."</p>

<p>"And the Legations!"<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> V. added.</p>

<p>More discussions followed. All wished for the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Legations, especially the lawyer and Luisa, but
Franco and Pedraglio were afraid to touch them,
fearing to stir up difficulties. They grew so warm
that Pedraglio entreated his companions to
"scream" in an undertone. "Scream softly,
children!" Then it was V.'s turn to propose going
to bed. He took his candle in his hand but did
not rise.</p>

<p>"Body of Bacchus!" said he, not knowing
whether he meant it as a conclusion or an exhortation.
Indeed he had a terrible desire to
talk, and to hear others talk, but could find nothing
new to say. "Body of Bacchus it is indeed!"
Franco exclaimed, who was in much the same state
of mind. A long silence ensued. At last Pedraglio
said, "Well?" and rose. "Shall we go?"
said Luisa, leading the way. "And the name?"
the lawyer asked. They all stopped. "What
name?" "The name of the new Kingdom!"
Franco set down his candle at once. "Well done!"
said he, "the name!" as if it had been a point that
must be settled before going to bed. Fresh discussions
followed. Piedmont? <i>Cisalpino?</i> Upper
Italy? Italy?</p>

<p>Luisa also was quick to put down her candle,
and as the others were not willing to accept his
"Italy," Pedraglio set his down also. But finding
the debate promised to be a long one, he resumed
it, and ran away, repeating: "Italy, Italy, Italy,
Italy!" heedless of the "hushes" and admonitions
of the others, who were following on tiptoe.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
They all stopped once more at the foot of the
stairs that Pedraglio and the lawyer must ascend
to reach their room, and exchanged good-nights.
Luisa entered the neighbouring alcove-room;
Franco waited to watch his friends upstairs.
"Look here!" he suddenly exclaimed. He had
been going to speak to them from the foot of the
stairs, but finally decided it was better to go up to
them. "And what if we are defeated?" he
whispered.</p>

<p>The lawyer simply uttered a contemptuous
"Nonsense!" but Pedraglio turning like a hyena,
seized Franco by the throat. They struggled
gaily there on the landing, and then once more
said good-night. Pedraglio rushed upwards, while
Franco flung himself downstairs.</p>

<p>His wife was waiting for him, standing in the
centre of the room, her eyes fixed on the door.
When she saw him enter she moved gravely towards
him, and folded him in a close embrace.
When, after a few moments had elapsed, he
moved as though to draw away, she silently
pressed him closer. Then Franco understood.
She was embracing him now as she had kissed him
before, when they had talked of all going to the
war. He pressed her temples between his hands,
kissed her again and again on the hair, saying
gently: "Dearest, think how great she will be
afterwards, this Italy!" "Yes, yes!" said she.
She raised her face to his, and offered him her
lips. She was not crying, but her eyes were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
moist. To feel himself gazed upon like this, to
be kissed thus, was indeed worth a few years of
life, for never, never before had her tenderness
towards him contained this humility.</p>

<p>"Then," said she, "we shall no longer live in
Valsolda. You will be obliged to assume the duties
of a citizen, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, certainly!"</p>

<p>They began to talk eagerly, both he and she,
about what they should do after the war, as if to
banish the thought of a terrible possibility. Luisa
let down her hair, and went to look at Maria in
her little bed. The child had probably been
roused some time before, and had put a tiny
finger in her mouth, which, little by little, as sleep
returned, had slipped out. Now she was sleeping
with her mouth open, and the little finger resting
on her chin. "Come here, Franco," said her
mother. Both bent over the bed. Maria's small
face held the sweetness of paradise.</p>

<p>Husband and wife lingered over her in silence,
and then rose, deeply moved. The interrupted
conversation was not resumed.</p>

<p>When they were in bed and the light put out,
Luisa murmured, on her husband's lips&mdash;</p>

<p>"If that day should come, you will go; but I
shall go also."</p>

<p>And she would not allow him to answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
THE GLOVED HAND</h2>

<p>To make his joke more complete Pasotti
reproached his wife for having repeated to
Signor Giacomo Don Giuseppe's speech concerning
the necessity of a marriage. The poor deaf
woman was thunderstruck; she knew nothing
either of a speech or of a marriage, and protested
that this was a calumny, entreating her husband
not to believe it, and was nearly beside herself
because the Controller still appeared to harbour
a suspicion. This malicious man was preparing
a treat for himself; he was going to tell Signor
Giacomo and Don Giuseppe that his wife wished
to make amends for the harm she had done, and
bring about a truce; in this way he would get all
three together at his house, and from behind a
door would enjoy the delicious scene that must
ensue between the wrathful Signor Giacomo, the
terrified Don Giuseppe, and the deaf and distracted
Barborin. But his plan failed, for his
wife could not wait, and ran off to the "Palace"
to clear herself.</p>

<p>She found Don Giuseppe and Maria in a state
of the most extraordinary agitation. Something
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
tremendous had happened to them, something that
Maria wished to tell, and Don Giuseppe did not.
However, the master yielded on condition that
she should not shout, but should convey her news
by signs. Meeting with opposition on this point
also, he, in his prudence, became furious, and the
servant did not insist.</p>

<p>A rumour had spread of a case of cholera at
Lugano, the victim being a man who had come
there from Milan, where the disease had broken
out; so Don Giuseppe had arranged to have all
provisions for the kitchen come from Porlezza
instead of Lugano, and had entrusted the commission
to Giacomo Panighet, the postman, who
brought the letters to Valsolda, not three times
a day, as at present, but twice a week, as was the
comfortable custom in the little world of long ago.
Now, not five minutes before Signora Pasotti's
arrival, Giacomo Panighet had brought the usual
basket, and in the bottom of that basket, beneath
the cabbages, they had discovered a note addressed
to Don Giuseppe. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"You, who play at primero with Don Franco
Maironi, should warn him that the air of Lugano
is far better than the air of Oria.</p>

<div class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Tivano.</span>"
</div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maria silently exhibited the basket, which was
still full, to Signora Pasotti, and by clever acting
illustrated the manner of discovery of the letter,
which she gave her to read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
    As soon as the deaf woman had finished reading,
a strange, indescribable pantomime began between
the three. Maria and Don Giuseppe, by
dint of gesticulations and rollings of their eyes,
expressed their surprise and terror; Barborin,
half frightened, half dazed, stared open-mouthed,
from one to the other, the letter still in her hand,
as if she had understood. As a matter of fact she
had made out only that the letter must be terrible.
Presently a thought struck her. She held the
letter out to Don Giuseppe with her left hand,
while with her right forefinger she pointed to the
word <i>Franco</i>; then she crossed her wrists with a
questioning gesture; and as the others, recognising
that the sign meant handcuffs, nodded their
heads violently in confirmation, she became half
frenzied, so great was her affection for Luisa, and
forgetting the matter that had brought her
there, she explained by signs, as if both the
others had been deaf also, that she would go
straight to Oria, see Don Franco, and give him
the letter.</p>

<p>She started to rush away, cramming the letter
into her pocket, and with hardly a word of leave-taking
to Don Giuseppe and Maria, who, greatly
distressed, were trying in vain to get hold of her,
to detain her and recommend all possible precautions.
But she slipped through their fingers,
and her great, tall bonnet quivering, her old grey
skirt dragging, set off at a trot towards Oria,
where she arrived quite out of breath, with her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
head full of gendarmes, inspections, scenes of
terror and of grief.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>She went up the stairs of the little Ribera
garden, making straight for the hall, where she
saw there were visitors. She recognised the
Receiver and the Imperial and Royal Commissary
of Porlezza, and was terrified, believing
they were come for the terrible blow, but then she
perceived Signora Bianconi and Signor Giacomo
Puttini, and once more breathed freely.</p>

<p>The Commissary, seated in the post of honour
on the large sofa, next to the Engineer-in-Chief,
talked a great deal, with much fluency and
brilliancy, looking oftenest at Franco, as if he
were the only person present upon whom it was
worth while to waste breath and wit. Franco,
lounging in an armchair, was mute and sullen,
like one who, in the house of another, perceives a
bad odour which good manners forbade him either
to flee from or curse. They were discussing the
Crimean campaign, and the Commissary was
praising the plan of the allied powers to attack the
colossus in that vital point, his ambition. He
spoke of the Russian barbarities, and of the autocrat
himself in such terms as to cause Franco to
tremble in his dread of an Anglo-Franco-Austrian
alliance, and Carlascia to open his eyes wide, for
he still held the views of 1848, and looked upon
the Czar as a good friend of the family. "And
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
you, Signor First-Political-Deputy, what do you
think of it?" said the Commissary, turning his
sarcastic smile upon Signor Giacomo. Puttini
winked his little eyes very hard, and having felt
his knees all over, replied: "Most respected
Signor Commissary, I know little about Russia,
France, or England, and I care still less. I let
them settle their own affairs. But, to speak the
truth, I am sorry for that poor dog 'Papuzza.'
He was as quiet as a young chicken until they
worried him, then when he called for help, fifty
rushed to his aid, and now they are all upon him,
devouring everything they can grab; and whether
poor 'Papuzza' win or lose, he will have nothing
left but his shirt."</p>

<p>This nickname "Papuzza,"&mdash;a Venetian distortion
of <i>Babbuccia</i> slippers&mdash;Signor Giacomo
applied to the Turk. "Papuzza" personified
Turkey in the form of one ideal Turk, with a huge
turban, a long beard, a big belly, and slippers.
Puttini, the peaceful, half free-thinker, had a
weakness for the lazy, placid, easy-going "Papuzza."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," the Commissary laughed.
"Your friend 'Papuzza' will come out all right.
We are his friends also, and will not allow him to
be mutilated or bled."</p>

<p>Franco, frowning sternly, could not refrain
from grumbling.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, that would be a great injustice
towards Russia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
    The Commissary was silent, and Signora Peppina,
displaying unusual tact, proposed going out
to see the flowers.</p>

<p>"A good idea!" said the engineer, who was
very glad to have the discussion interrupted.</p>

<p>While passing from the hall to the little garden
the Commissary took Franco's arm familiarly, and
whispered in his ear: "You are right, you know,
about the injustice; but there are certain things
we government officials may not say." Franco,
who was greatly astonished at this utterance,
felt as if the touch of the Imperial and Royal
hand were burning him. If this man had had
a more Italian face he would have believed him,
but with that Kalmuc countenance he did not
believe him, and allowed the subject to drop.
But his companion resumed it in a low tone, as
he leaned over the parapet above the lake, and
pretended to examine the <i>ficus repens</i> that covered
the wall.</p>

<p>"You yourself should avoid certain expressions,"
said he. "There are fools who might place
false interpretations upon them." And he gave
a slight nod in the direction of the Receiver.
"Be careful, be careful!" "Thank you," Franco
replied, dryly, "but I hardly think I shall need to
be careful." "We can never be sure, never be
sure, never be sure!" the Commissary murmured,
and, followed by Franco, he moved away towards
the spot where the Receiver and the engineer were
discussing the subject of tench, near the few steps
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
leading down to the second terrace of the little
garden.</p>

<p>Close at hand stood the famous red box with the
jasmine.</p>

<p>"That red does not look well, Signor Maironi,"
said the mastiff, <i>ex abrupto</i>, and he threw up his
hand with a gesture that meant, "Away with it!"
Just then Luisa looked into the garden from the
hall, and called her husband. The Commissary
turned to his zealous acolyte, and said sharply,
"Drop that!"</p>

<p>Signora Pasotti was leaving, and wished to
salute Franco. He would have shown her out
through the garden, but she, anxious to avoid
going through so many ceremonies with those
other gentlemen, preferred to go down by the inside
stairs, and Franco escorted her as far as the street-door,
which stood open. To his great surprise
Signora Pasotti, instead of passing out, closed the
door, and began an excited and perfectly unintelligible
pantomime, accompanying it with short
sighs and rollings of the eyes; after this she took
a letter from her pocket and offered it to him.</p>

<p>Franco read, shrugged his shoulders, and put
the letter in his pocket. Then as Signora Pasotti
kept on recommending flight, flight&mdash;Lugano,
Lugano, in despairing pantomime, he smiled and
reassured her by a gesture. She once more
seized his hands, and once more the lofty bonnet
(which had a tipsy inclination towards the right),
and the long black curls, trembled in earnest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
supplication. She strained her eyes wide, pushed
out her lips as far as possible, and laid her forefinger
against her nose to indicate silence. "With
Pasotti also!" she said; and these were the only
words she spoke during the whole interview.
Then she trotted away.</p>

<p>Franco went upstairs again, thinking about his
position. This might be a false alarm, just as it
might also be a serious matter. But why should
they arrest him? He tried to remember if he had
anything of a compromising nature in the house,
and could recall nothing. It flashed across his
mind that his grandmother might have been
guilty of some perfidy, but he at once banished the
thought, reproaching himself, and postponed a
decision until he should have spoken to his
wife.</p>

<p>He returned to the little garden, where the
Commissary, as soon as he caught sight of him,
asked him to point out the dahlias Signora Peppina
had been praising. Upon learning that they
were in the kitchen-garden he proposed going
there with Franco. They could go alone, for
indeed all the others were ignorant on the subject
of dahlias. Franco accepted.</p>

<p>The conduct of this little police-spy in gloves
puzzled him, and he sought to discover if it could
in any way be connected with the mysterious
warning.</p>

<p>"Listen, Signor Maironi," the Commissary began
resolutely, when Franco had closed the gate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of the kitchen-garden behind him. "I wish to
say a word to you."</p>

<p>Franco who was descending the few steps leading
from the threshold of the gate, stopped with a
clouded brow. "Come here," the Commissary
added imperiously. "What I am about to do is
perhaps not in accordance with my duty, but I
shall do it, notwithstanding. I am too good a
friend of the Marchesa, your grandmother, not to
do it. You are in great danger."</p>

<p>"I?" Franco inquired, coldly. "In danger of
what?"</p>

<p>Franco was endowed with a rapid and sure
intuition of the thoughts of others. The Commissary's
words agreed perfectly with the message
Barborin had brought; still, at that moment
he felt that the little police-spy harboured treachery
in his heart.</p>

<p>"In danger of what? Of Mantua!" was Zérboli's
reply.</p>

<p>Franco did not flinch upon hearing the awful
word, synonym of incarceration and the gibbet.</p>

<p>"I need not fear Mantua," said he. "I have
done nothing to deserve Mantua."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Of what am I accused?" Franco repeated.</p>

<p>"You will soon find out if you remain here,"
the Commissary replied, laying stress upon the
last words. "And now let us examine these
dahlias."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
    "I have done nothing!" Franco once more repeated.
"I will not leave."</p>

<p>"Let us see these dahlias, let us see these
dahlias," the Commissary insisted.</p>

<p>Franco felt that he should thank this man, but
he could not. He showed him his flowers with
just that amount of civility that was indispensable,
and with perfect composure. Then he conducted
him from the kitchen-garden to the house, talking
of some obscure Professor Maspero, and of his
secret method of combating <i>oidium</i>.</p>

<p>In the hall they were discussing another and far
worse form of <i>oidium</i>. Signora Peppina was
harassed by a terrible fear of cholera. She
recognised that cholera served as a warning to
every good Christian to make his peace with God,
and that when we are at peace with God, it is indeed
a blessing to be called to the next world,
"but still, this body of ours, you know! This
precious body! And when you reflect that we
have only one!"</p>

<p>"The cholera," said Luisa, "might do no end of
good, if it had any sense, but it has not. You
see," she whispered to Signora Peppina as Bianconi
rose and went towards the Commissary, who
had returned with Franco, "the cholera is quite
capable of taking you, and leaving your husband."
At this extraordinary remark the terrified Peppina
started violently, exclaiming: "<i>Jesusmaria!</i>" and
then, perceiving she had betrayed her true feelings,
that she had not exhibited that tenderness for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Carlascia of which she was always prating, she
clutched her neighbour's knee, and bending forward,
said in an undertone, her face as red as a
poppy: "Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!"</p>

<p>But Luisa was no longer thinking of her. A
glance from Franco had warned her that something
had happened.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When all the visitors had departed, Uncle Piero
sat down to read the <i>Milan Gazette</i>, and Luisa said
to her husband: "It is three o'clock. Let us go
and wake Maria."</p>

<p>When he and she were alone in the alcove-room,
instead of at once opening the shutters, she inquired
what had happened. Franco told her
everything, from Signora Pasotti's letter to the
Commissary's strange communication.</p>

<p>Luisa listened with a serious face, but without
exhibiting any sign of fear. Then she examined
the mysterious note. Both she and Franco were
aware that among the government agents at
Porlezza there was one honest man, who, in 1849
and 1850 had saved several patriots by a timely
warning. But they were also aware that this
honest man was ignorant of the rules of orthography
and grammar, and the note Barborin had
brought was perfectly correct. As to the Commissary,
it was well known that he was one of the
most malicious and treacherous of the government's
tools. Luisa approved of the answer her
husband had made him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
    Franco himself was well aware of all this, but he
could find no plausible explanation for this persecution.
Luisa, however, had one in mind which
contempt for the grandmother had suggested to
her. This Commissary was a good friend of the
grandmother's, he himself had said so, thereby
displaying, so he thought, the refinement of cunning.
In the Commissary's glove there was the
talon of the Marchesa. She meant to strike not
Franco alone, but all the others as well, and they
were to be reached through him who maintained
the family with the fruit of his labours, out of the
kindness of his generous heart. She knew from
speeches which had been repeated to her by the
usual hateful gossips, that the grandmother hated
Uncle Piero because Uncle Piero had made it
possible for her grandson to rebel against her, and
to live comfortably enough in rebellion. Now
they were seeking for a pretext to strike him.
The flight of the nephew would be a confession,
and, for a government like the Austrian, a good
pretext to strike the uncle. Luisa did not say so
at once, but she let him see that she had an idea,
and little by little, her husband drew it from her.
When she had told him, though in his heart he
believed she was right, he nevertheless protested
in words, defending his grandmother against an
accusation which seemed too monstrous, and
which rested on so slight a foundation. At all
events husband and wife agreed perfectly in their
resolve not to flee, but to await further developments.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
They therefore wasted no time in making
or discussing suppositions. Luisa rose and went
to open the shutters, and standing in the full
light, she turned to look smilingly at her husband,
stretching out her hand to him. He pressed
it and shook it, his heart aflame, but his tongue
speechless. They felt like soldiers, who, conscious
of the distant roar of cannon, are being led along
a quiet road, towards what fate God only knows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE HAND WITHIN THE GLOVE</h2>

<p>The Engineer-in-Chief noticed nothing, and
two days later, the term of his leave having
expired, he went away peacefully in his boat,
wrapped in his great, grey travelling cloak, and
accompanied by Cia, the housekeeper. Ten days
passed without further developments, and Franco
and Luisa concluded that a trap had been set for
them, and that, after all, the police would not
appear. On the evening of the first of October
they played <i>tarocchi</i> merrily with Puttini and
Pasotti, and then, their guests having left early,
they went to bed. When Luisa kissed the child,
who was sleeping, she noticed that her flesh was
hot. She felt of her hands and legs. "Maria is
feverish," she said.</p>

<p>Franco took up the candle and looked at her.
Maria was sleeping with her little head drooping
towards her left shoulder as usual. The lovely
little face which always wore a frown when she was
asleep, was slightly flushed, and the breathing
rather quick. Franco was alarmed, and at once
thought of scarlet fever, the measles, gastric, and
brain fever. Luisa, who was more calm, thought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of worms, and prepared a dose of santonine,
which she placed ready on the pedestal. Then
both father and mother went noiselessly to bed,
put out the light and lay listening anxiously to
the little one's short, quick breathing. At last
they dozed, but towards midnight they were
aroused by Maria, who was crying. They lighted
the candle and Maria became quiet and took the
santonine. Then presently she began to cry
again, and wanted to be taken into the big bed,
between mamma and papa, and finally went to
sleep there; but her sleep was uneasy and often
interrupted by sobs.</p>

<p>Franco kept the candle burning that he might
watch her more closely. He and his wife were
bending over their darling when two knocks
sounded in quick succession on the street-door.
Franco started up in bed. "Did you hear?"
said he. "Hush!" said Luisa, grasping his arm,
and listening. Two more knocks sounded, louder
still, and Franco exclaimed: "The Police!" and
sprang to the floor. "Go, go!" Luisa begged in a
low tone. "Don't let them take you! Go by the
little courtyard! Climb over the wall!" He did
not answer, but hastily threw on some clothes and
rushed from the room, heedless of danger, and
determined never of his own free will to leave his
Luisa and his sick child.</p>

<p>He dashed down the stairs. "Who is there?"
he inquired, without opening the door. "The
Police!" some one answered. "Open at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
    "At this hour I open to no one I do not see."</p>

<p>A short dialogue ensued in the street. The
voice he had heard first said: "You speak to him,"
and the voice that spoke next was very familiar
to Franco.</p>

<p>"Open, Signor Maironi."</p>

<p>It was the Receiver. Franco threw the door
open. A gentleman, dressed in black and wearing
spectacles, entered, and was followed by the mastiff;
after the mastiff came a gendarme with a
lantern, then three other armed gendarmes, two
of whom were subalterns while the other was of
higher rank, and carried a large leathern bag.
Some one remained outside.</p>

<p>"Are you Signor Maironi?" said the man in
spectacles, a police-adjunct, or detective from
Milan. "Come upstairs with me." And the
whole party started upstairs, with the thud of
heavy steps and the rattling of military trappings.</p>

<p>They had not yet reached the first floor when a
light fell on the stairs from above, and sobs and
groans were heard on the second floor.</p>

<p>"Is that your wife?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"Do you fancy it is?" Franco retorted ironically.
The Receiver murmured: "It is probably
the servant." The detective turned and
gave an order; two gendarmes started forward
and went rapidly up to the second floor. More
sharply than before the adjunct asked Franco:
"Is your wife in bed?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
    "Of course."</p>

<p>"Where? She must get up."</p>

<p>The door of the alcove-room was thrown open,
and Luisa appeared in her dressing-gown, with
flowing hair, and bearing a candle in her hand.
At the same moment a gendarme leaned over the
banisters on the upper floor, and said that the
servant had nearly fainted away, and could not
come down. The detective ordered him to leave
his companion with the woman, and to descend.
Then he saluted the lady, who did not reply. In
the hope that Franco had fled, she had hastened
to leave the room in order to detain and, if possible,
deceive the police. She now saw her husband
and shuddered, her heart beating wildly,
but she composed herself at once.</p>

<p>The detective stepped forward to enter the
room. "No!" Franco exclaimed. "Some one
is ill in there." Luisa clutched the handle of the
closed door, looking the man straight in the face.</p>

<p>"Who is ill?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"A little girl."</p>

<p>"Well, what harm do you suppose we shall do
her?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Luisa almost defiantly, and
giving the handle a nervous shake, "must you all
go in?"</p>

<p>"All of us."</p>

<p>At the sound of voices and the rattling of the
door-handle little Maria had begun to cry in a
weary and forlorn voice that was heart-rending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
    "Luisa," said Franco, "let these <i>gentlemen</i> do
their work."</p>

<p>The detective was a fashionably-dressed young
man, with a refined but cruel face. He threw
Franco a sinister glance. "Obey your husband,
Signora," said he, glad of an opportunity to
retaliate. "I think he is prudent."</p>

<p>"Less prudent than you are, who bring a whole
army as escort," Luisa retorted, opening the door.
He glanced at her, shrugged his shoulders, and
passed in, followed by the others.</p>

<p>"Open everything here," said he roughly, in a
loud voice, pointing to the writing-desk. Franco's
big, blue eyes flashed. "Speak softly!" said he.
"Do not frighten my child."</p>

<p>"Silence, you!" the detective thundered, bringing
his fist down upon the desk. "Open!"</p>

<p>At that noise the child began to sob violently.
Franco, who was furious, flung the key upon the
desk.</p>

<p>"Open it yourself," said he.</p>

<p>"You are under arrest!" cried the detective.</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>While Franco was answering thus, Luisa, who
had bent low over her baby, trying to pacify her,
raised her face impetuously.</p>

<p>"I also have a right to that honour," said she,
in her fine, ringing voice.</p>

<p>The detective did not deign to reply, but ordered
a gendarme to open all the drawers of the writing-desk,
and he himself searched them, removing all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the letters, examining them rapidly, throwing
some on the floor, and tossing others into the
great leathern bag. After the writing-desk it
was the turn of the chests of drawers, where everything
was turned upside down. Then Maria's
little bed was inspected. The detective ordered
Luisa to remove the child from the big bed, which
he also intended to examine.</p>

<p>"Then put the little bed in order for me,"
Luisa replied, quivering with rage. Up to this
moment, the mastiff, Carlascia, had stood silent
and stiff behind his moustaches, as if this operation,
which he had perhaps desired in the abstract,
were proving not entirely to his taste, now
that it was being put into practice. He came
forward and began arranging the mattresses and
sheets of the little bed with his great ugly paws.
Luisa placed the child in it, and then the large bed
was torn to pieces and examined, but without
any result. Maria had stopped crying, and was
staring at the scene of confusion with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"Now follow me, both of you," said the adjunct.
Luisa, who believed she was to be led
away with her husband, demanded that the servant
be summoned, that she might give the child
into her care. At the idea that Luisa was under
arrest, that the sick child was to be deprived of
her mother also, Franco, beside himself with rage
and grief, uttered a protesting cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is not possible! Say it is not so!"</p>

<p>The detective did not vouchsafe a reply, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
ordered that the servant be brought in. The
maid, half dead with fright, entered between two
gendarmes, groaning and sobbing.</p>

<p>"Fool!" Franco muttered between his teeth.</p>

<p>"The woman will stay here with the child,"
said the adjunct. "Both of you will come with
me. You must be present when the rest of the
house is searched." He sent for some lights, left
a gendarme in the alcove-room, and went into the
hall, followed by the other gendarmes, Bianconi,
Franco, and Luisa.</p>

<p>"Before continuing the search," said he, "I
will ask you a question I should have asked before
had your conduct been more correct. Tell me
whether you have any weapons, or seditious publications,
or papers either printed or in manuscript,
which are hostile to the Imperial and Royal
Government."</p>

<p>Franco answered, in a loud tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That is what we shall see," said the detective.</p>

<p>"Do as you like."</p>

<p>While the adjunct was causing furniture to be
moved away from the wall, and was searching and
peering everywhere, Luisa remembered that eight
or ten years before her uncle had shown her in the
chest of drawers of a room on the second floor, an
old sabre that had lain there ever since 1812. It
had belonged to another Pietro Ribera, a lieutenant
of cavalry, who had fallen at Malojaroslavetz.
No one ever slept in that room above the kitchen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and it was seldom entered; it was as if it did not
exist. Luisa had completely forgotten the old
sabre of the Empire. Oh, God! now she recalled
it! What if her uncle had forgotten it also?
What if he had not given it up in 1848, after the
war, when orders had been issued to deliver up all
weapons, under pain of death? Had her uncle
grasped the fact, in his patriarchal simplicity,
that this heir-loom that had lain for six-and-thirty
years at the bottom of a drawer, had now
become a dangerous and forbidden object? And
Franco, Franco who knew nothing! Luisa was
resting her hands on the back of a chair; it
creaked sharply under her convulsive pressure.
She withdrew her hands, frightened, as if the
chair had spoken.</p>

<p>In fancy she saw the adjunct pass from room to
room with his gendarmes, and arrive at that door,
open the drawer, and discover the sabre. She
made every effort to recall the exact position in
which she had seen it, to find some way out of this
danger; and she was silent, mechanically following
with her eyes the candle which a gendarme,
in obedience to his chief's gestures, held close,
now to an open drawer or cupboard, now to a
picture which the detective had lifted, that he
might look behind it. No, she could think of no
remedy. If her uncle had failed to remove the
sabre, she could only trust they would not visit
that room.</p>

<p>Franco, leaning against the stove, was following
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
every motion of the searchers with a clouded brow.
When they plunged their hands into the drawers,
his rage was visible in the silent working of his
jaws. Nothing was heard save, now and then, a
sharp order from the detective, and a low-toned
reply from the gendarmes. Nothing moved
around them, save their great shadows wavering
on the walls. The silence of the Receiver, of
Franco and Luisa, was like the silence of those
who have risked great sums in a secret gaming-house,
and stand about the players who, from
time to time, speak some brief word. The sinister
face and voice of the detective never changed,
although he had not discovered anything. To
Luisa he seemed a man sure of achieving his purpose.
And not to be able to do anything, not even
warn Franco! But perhaps it was better he did
not know; perhaps his ignorance would save
him.</p>

<p>Having searched the hall and the loggia the
detective entered the salon. He took the candle
from the gendarme's hands and swiftly examined
the little, illustrious men.</p>

<p>Seeing the portraits of Gouvion Saint-Cyr,
Marmont, and other generals of Napoleon, he
said: "The Engineer-in-Chief Ribera would have
done far better to hang the portrait of His Excellency
Field-Marshal Radetzky on his walls.
Is it here?"</p>

<p>"No," said Franco.</p>

<p>"A nice government official!" said the other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
contemptuously, and with indescribable arrogance.</p>

<p>"Are government officials bound," Franco
burst forth, "to hang the portraits&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not here to argue with you," the detective
said, interrupting him.</p>

<p>Franco was about to answer. "Be quiet, you
with your tongue a yard long!" said the Receiver,
brutally.</p>

<p>The detective passed from the drawing-room
into the corridor leading to the stairs. Would he
go up or not, Luisa wondered. He went up, and
she followed him, not trembling, but imagining
with a dizzy rapidity, the many different things
that might happen. All the possibilities of the
moment, both disastrous and favourable, were
whirling, as it were, in her head. If she lingered
upon the first, horror carried her with a bound to
the second; if she dwelt upon these, fancy returned
with perverse eagerness to the first.</p>

<p>Before they had set foot in the corridor of the
second floor they heard Maria crying. Franco
begged the adjunct to allow his wife to go down
to the child, but she protested that she wished to
remain. The idea of not being with him when
the weapon was discovered, terrified her. Meanwhile
the detective had entered a small room
where there were some books, and finding a
volume printed at Capolago, and bearing the
title, Literary Writings of a Living Italian, he
said: "Who is this living Italian?" "Padre
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Cesari," Franco replied boldly. The other, deceived
by his prompt answer and the priestly
name, assumed the air of a man of culture, saying:
"Ah! I am acquainted with his works." Replacing
the book, he inquired where the Engineer-in-Chief
slept.</p>

<p>Luisa was too completely dominated by the one
great dread to sense anything else, but Franco,
when he saw the police-agent and his band enter
the uncle's room, which was so clean, so neat, so
full of his dear, calm spirit, when he reflected what
a blow to the poor old man the news of all this
would be, was completely overcome, and could
have wept with rage. "It seems to me," he said,
"that this one room at least should be respected."</p>

<p>"Keep your observations to yourself," the
adjunct retorted, and began by ordering the
blankets and mattresses stripped from the bed.
Then he demanded the key to the chest of drawers.
Franco had it, and went down to his room for it,
accompanied by a gendarme. The uncle had entrusted
it to him before leaving, telling him that
in case of need he would find a small amount of
<i>cum quibus</i> in the top drawer. They opened it.
It contained a roll of <i>svanziche</i>, a few letters and
papers, some pocket-books, old note-books, compasses,
pencils, and a small wooden bowl in which
were several coins.</p>

<p>The detective examined everything carefully,
discovering among the coins in the little bowl a
five-franc piece of the time of Carlo Alberto, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
a forty-franc piece of the Provisory Government
of Lombardy. "The Engineer-in-Chief has preserved
these coins with extraordinary care,"
said the detective; "henceforth we will preserve
them." He closed the drawer, and, without
opening the others, returned the key to Franco.</p>

<p>Then he went out into the corridor and paused,
undecided. The Receiver thought he intended to
go down, and as the corridor was nearly dark, and
the stairs were not visible, he, who was acquainted
with the house, started towards the right in the
direction of the stairs, saying: "This way."
The room where the sabre lay was on the left.</p>

<p>"Wait," said the adjunct. "Let us look in
here, also." And turning, he pushed open the
fatal door. Luisa, who had been the last in the
procession, pressed forward, now that the supreme
moment had arrived. Her heart, which had beat
furiously while the adjunct hesitated, now became
quiet as by a miracle, and she was cool,
daring, and ready.</p>

<p>"Who sleeps here?" the detective asked her.</p>

<p>"No one. My uncle's parents used to occupy
this room, but they have been dead these forty
years, and no one has slept here since."</p>

<p>The room contained two beds, a sofa, and a
chest of drawers. This the detective signed to
the gendarmes to open. They tried it, but it
was locked. "I think I have the key," said
Luisa with the utmost indifference. She went
down, accompanied by a gendarme, and returned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
immediately with a little basket of keys
which she offered to the detective.</p>

<p>"I do not know the key," she said. "It is
never used. It must be one of these."</p>

<p>He tried them all, but in vain. Then the Receiver
tried, and then Franco. The right one was
not there.</p>

<p>"Send to S. Mamette for the lock-smith," said
Luisa, calmly. The Receiver looked at the detective
as if to say: "It seems to me unnecessary,"
but the detective turned his back upon him and
exclaimed to Luisa: "This key must be somewhere!"</p>

<p>The chest of drawers, a piece of <i>rococo</i> furniture,
had metal handles to each drawer. One
of the gendarmes, the strongest, tried to force the
drawers open. He did not succeed either with the
top one or with the second. Just at that
moment Luisa remembered that she had seen the
sabre in the third drawer, together with a roll of
drawings. The gendarme seized the handles of
the third. "This one is not locked," said he. In
fact it opened easily. The detective took the
light and bent over to examine it.</p>

<p>Franco had seated himself on the sofa, his eyes
fixed on the rafters of the ceiling. When his wife
saw the drawer pulled open she sank down beside
him, took his hand, and pressed it spasmodically.</p>

<p>She heard some papers rustle, and the Receiver
murmured, in a benign voice: "Drawings."
Then the detective exclaimed: "Ah!" and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
satellites all leaned forward to see. She had the
strength to rise and inquire; "What is it?"
The detective was holding a long pasteboard case,
curved and slim, and bearing a label with an
inscription. He had already read the inscription
to himself; he now read it aloud with an accent
of ineffable sarcasm and satisfaction. "The
sabre of Lieutenant Pietro Ribera, killed at
Malojaroslavetz in 1812." Franco started to his
feet, astounded and incredulous, and at the same
moment the adjunct opened the case. From
where he stood Franco could not see it, and he
glanced at his wife, who could. Her lips were
white and he thought it was with fright, although
this did not seem possible.</p>

<p>But her lips were white with joy, for the case
contained only an empty scabbard. Luisa suddenly
drew back into the shadow and sank upon
the sofa, struggling with a violent inward trembling,
vexed with herself and ashamed of her
weakness, which however, she soon conquered.
Meanwhile the detective, who had removed the
scabbard and examined it on all sides, asked
Franco where the sabre was. Franco was about
to answer that he did not know, which was perfectly
true, but reflecting that this might seem
like self-justification, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Russia."</p>

<p>The sabre was not in Russia, but fast in the mud,
at the bottom of the lake, where Uncle Piero had
secretly flung it rather than give it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
    "But why did they write sabre?" inquired the
Receiver, wishing to show he also was zealous.</p>

<p>"The writer is dead," said Franco.</p>

<p>"Hand over that key at once!" the detective
scolded angrily. And this time Luisa found it,
and the two other drawers were opened. One
was empty, the other contained some blankets
and a little lavender.</p>

<p>The search ended here. The adjunct went
down to the drawing-room, and ordered Franco
to make ready to follow him in fifteen minutes.
"You had better arrest all of us then!" Luisa
exclaimed.</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders, and repeated
to Franco: "In fifteen minutes. You may go
to your room, now, if you wish to." Franco
dragged Luisa away entreating her to be silent,
to resign herself for love of Maria. He seemed
like another man, exhibiting neither grief nor
anger, and there was in his voice a ring of serious
sweetness, of manly calm.</p>

<p>He put some linen into a bag, together with a
volume of Dante and an <i>Almanach du Jardinier</i>,
which were on the table, bent over Maria for a
moment but did not kiss her, for she had gone to
sleep, and he feared to wake her. He kissed
Luisa, however, but as they were being observed
by the gendarmes stationed at either door of the
room, he quickly freed himself from her embrace,
saying, in French, that they must not provide a
spectacle for those gentlemen. Then he took up
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
his bag, and went to place himself at the detective's
orders.</p>

<p>The police-adjunct had a boat waiting not fifty
paces from Casa Ribera, towards Albogasio, at
the landing called <i>del Canevaa</i>. Upon issuing
from the portico spanned by his house, Franco
heard a shutter being thrown open above his head,
and saw the light from his bedroom flash against
the white façade of the church. He turned
towards the window, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Send for the doctor to-morrow morning.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Luisa did not answer.</p>

<p>When the gendarmes reached the Canevaa with
their prisoner, the adjunct ordered them to stop.</p>

<p>"Signor Maironi," said he, "you have had your
lesson. This time you may return to your home,
and I advise you to learn to respect the Authorities."</p>

<p>Amazement, joy, and indignation welled up in
Franco's heart. He controlled himself, however,
biting his lips, and started homewards at a leisurely
pace. He had not yet turned the corner of the
church when Luisa recognised his step, and called,
"Franco!"</p>

<p>He sprang forward, and she saw him. Then
her shadow vanished from the window. He
rushed into the house, flung himself up the stairs,
crying, "Free! Free!" while his wife came
flying down, exclaiming wildly, "How! How!
How!" They sought each other with eager arms,
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
clung together, pressing close, without further
speech.</p>

<p>But afterwards, in the loggia, they talked
incessantly for two hours, of all they had heard,
seen, and experienced, always coming back to the
sabre, the papers, the coins, dwelling upon many
trifling details, on the detective's Venetian accent,
on the dark-haired gendarme, who seemed a good
fellow, and the fair-haired gendarme, who must be
a regular cur. From time to time they would
cease speaking, enjoying in silence their sense of
security, the sweetness of home, but presently they
would begin again. Before going to bed they
stepped out on the terrace. The night was dark
and warm, the lake motionless. The sultriness,
the gloom, the vague and monstrous shapes of
the mountains, seemed to their imagination
heavy with the mortal weight of Austria. The
very air itself seemed full of it. Neither Franco
nor Luisa was sleepy, but they must go to bed on
account of the servant who was watching with
Maria. They entered the room on tiptoe. The
child was sleeping, her breathing almost normal.</p>

<p>They also tried to sleep, but could not. They
could not refrain from talking, especially Franco.
He would ask softly: "Are you asleep?" and
upon her answering, "No," the coins, the papers,
the sabre, or the bully with his Venetian accent
would be discussed once more. By this time
there was nothing new to be said on these subjects,
and, as Maria began to be restless, and to show
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
signs of waking, towards dawn, Luisa answered,
"Yes," the next time Franco inquired softly,
"Are you asleep?" and after that he kept quiet,
as if he really believed it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The day after the search at Casa Ribera, Oria,
Albogasio, and S. Mamette were full of whisperings.
"Have you heard?&mdash;Oh, dear Lord!&mdash;Have you
heard?&mdash;Oh, holy Madonna!" But the loudest
whisperings were of course those that communicated
the news to Barborin Pasotti. Her husband
shouted into her face: "Maironi! Police! Gendarmes!
Arrest!" The poor woman concluded an
army had swept her friends away, and began to
puff&mdash;"oh! oh!"&mdash;like an engine. Then she
groaned and wept, and questioned Pasotti about
the child. Pasotti, who was determined not to
allow her to go down to Oria and exhibit her
affection for the Maironis under these circumstances,
replied with a gesture like the sweep of a
broom. Gone! Gone! She also!&mdash;But the servant?
The servant must surely be there still.
The crafty man made another sweeping gesture
in the air, and then Barborin grasped the fact
that His Imperial and Royal Austrian Majesty
had had the servant carried off as well.</p>

<p>But the most malicious whisperings were uttered
at a great distance from Valsolda, in a room
in the Maironi Palace, at Brescia. Ten days
after the search the Chevalier Greisberg di S.
Giustina, a cousin of the Maironis, who had been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
attached to the government of Field-Marshal
Radetzky in Verona until 1853, and had then
accompanied his master to Milan, alighted at the
door of Casa Maironi from the carriage of the
Imperial and Royal Delegate of Brescia, whose
guest he had been for some days. The Chevalier,
a handsome man of about forty, perfumed, and
smartly dressed, did not look particularly happy
as he stood very erect in the centre of the reception
room, examining the ancient stucco-work
of the ceiling, and waiting for the Marchesa, who
was of the same period. Nevertheless, when the
door opposite him, pushed open by a servant's
hand, admitted Madam's big person, marble
countenance, and black wig, the Chevalier was at
once transformed, and kissed the old lady's
wrinkled hand with fervour. A Lombard gentlewoman
devoted to Austria was a rare animal, and
extremely precious to the Imperial and Royal
government. Every loyal functionary owed her
the most obsequious gallantry. The Marchesa
received the homage of her cousin the Chevalier
with her usual unruffled dignity, and having invited
him to be seated, enquired after his family
and thanked him for his call, all in the same
guttural and sleepy tone. Finally, slightly out
of breath from the fatigue of uttering so many
words, she crossed her hands over her stomach,
and let it be seen that she was now waiting for
what her cousin might have to say.</p>

<p>She expected he would speak about Engineer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Ribera and the search. She had on previous
occasions expressed to him her displeasure that
Franco should be under the influence of his wife
and Ribera, and her surprise that the government
should retain in its service one who in 1848 had
openly played the Liberal, and whose family&mdash;especially
that artful young woman&mdash;professed
the most impudent Liberalism. The Chevalier
Greisberg had assured her that her wise observations
should be given due consideration. Then
the Marchesa had instigated the Commissary
Zérboli against the poor Engineer-in-Chief, and it
had been through Zérboli that she had heard of
the search. Therefore, when Greisberg appeared
she concluded he had come to speak of that.
Now, she was quite willing to make the government
serve her own private rancour, but, as a
matter of principle, she never recognised a debt
of gratitude toward any one. By thus subjecting
a doubtful functionary to examination, the Austrian
government had been working in its own
interests. She had not asked for anything; it
was not for her to ask, it was for the Chevalier to
speak first. But the Chevalier, cunning, sly, and
proud, did not understand his rôle in this way.
The old woman wanted a favour, and in order to
obtain it she must bow down and kiss the beneficent
claws of government.</p>

<p>He remained silent for some time, to collect
his thoughts, and in the hope that the other would
yield. Seeing that she remained mute and unbending,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
he himself became suddenly smiling and
gracious, told her that he had come from Verona,
and proposed that she guess what route he had
taken. He had passed through such a sweet town,
had seen such a charming villa, so splendid, a
real paradise! The Marchesa was not good at
guessing; she asked if he had been in Brianza.
No, he had not come from Verona to Brescia by
way of Brianza. He once more described the
villa, and this time so minutely that the Marchesa
could not help recognising her own estate of
Monzambano. Then the Chevalier proposed that
she guess why he had gone to see the villa. She
guessed at once, guessed the whole plot of the
comedy that was being acted for her benefit, but
her dull face said nothing of this. The Delegate
had once before sounded her to ascertain if she
would be willing to let the villa to His Excellency
the Marshal, but she&mdash;having been secretly
threatened with fire and death by the Liberals
of Brescia&mdash;had found some polite excuses. She
now perceived in Greisberg's words the tacit offer
of a bargain, and stood on her guard. She confessed
to her cousin that she was unable to guess
even this. Indeed she felt she was growing more
and more stupid every day. The effect of years
and grief! "I have had a great grief very lately,"
she said. "I am told that the Police have searched
my grandson's house at Oria."</p>

<p>Greisberg, feeling that this elderly hypocrite
was slipping through his fingers, now pulled off
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
his glove, and seized her with his talons. "Marchesa,"
said he, in a tone which admitted of no
rejoinder, "you must not speak of grief! Through
the Commissary of Porlezza and myself, you have
furnished precious information to the government,
of which service it is not unmindful. Not a hair
of your grandson's head was touched, nor will be,
if he is judicious. But, on the other hand, I
regret that we may perhaps not be able to adopt
severe measures against another person who has
injured you seriously in private matters. In
order to find a means of reaching this person the
Commissary has even exceeded his duty. You
must understand once for all, Marchesa, that this
is not a question of grief, and that you are especially
indebted to the government." The Marchesa
had never before been spoken to in such strong
language and with such formidable authority.
Perhaps the continuous, undulating movement
of neck and head visible above her stiffly-held
body, corresponded with the angry beating of
her heart, but it seemed the movement of some
animal struggling to swallow an enormous mouthful.
At any rate she did not unbend sufficiently
to speak a word of acquiescence. Only, having
regained her obese calm, she observed that she
had never demanded that measures be adopted
against any one; that she was glad the search had
revealed nothing incriminating against Engineer
Ribera; that, nevertheless, all sorts of things had
been said in Casa Ribera, but that words were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
difficult to trace. The Chevalier replied more
gently, that he could not say whether anything
had been discovered, and that the last word
would be spoken by the Marshal himself, who
intended to give this matter his personal attention.
This remark enabled him to return to the subject
of the villa at Monzambano. He asked for it
formally for His Excellency, who wished to go
there within a week. The Marchesa thanked
him for the great honour, which she said, her villa
did not deserve; it seemed to her too dilapidated,
it wanted repairing, and His Excellency must be
informed of this. She wished to defer her decision,
to await the payment of the miserable
price of her condescension, but the Chevalier
struck another blow with his talons, and declared
she must answer at once, answer clearly,
yes or no, and the old lady was forced to bow her
head. "To accommodate His Excellency," she
said. Greisberg at once became amiable again,
and jested about the measures to be adopted
against that <i>Signor Ingegnere</i>. There was no
question of spilling blood, only a little ink need
be spilled. There was no question of depriving
any one of liberty, rather of conferring perfect
liberty on somebody. The Marchesa made no
sign. She sent for two lemonades, and drank hers
slowly in little sips, not without a faint expression
of satisfaction between the sips, as if this lemonade
had a new and exquisite flavour. But the
Chevalier wished for an explicit word from her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
concerning Ribera, a confession of her desire,
and placing the glass he had hastily drained upon
the tray, he said, "I will see to this myself, you
know, and we shall succeed. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>The Marchesa continued to sip the lemonade
slowly, slowly, gazing into the glass.</p>

<p>"Does that suit you?" her cousin asked, having
waited in vain for an answer.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very good," the drowsy voice replied.
"I drink it slowly on account of my teeth."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The last whisperings were not human. Luisa
and Franco were seated on the grass at Looch,
near the cemetery. They were speaking of the
mother's great and exquisite goodness, and comparing
it to Uncle Piero's great and simple goodness,
noting the similarity and the differences.
They did not say which sort of goodness, taken
as a whole, seemed to them superior, but from
the opinions each expressed, their different inclinations
could be divined. Franco preferred
that goodness which is permeated with faith in
the supernatural, while Luisa preferred the other
form of goodness. He was grieved by this secret
contradiction, but hesitated to reveal it, fearing
to sound a too painful note. But it had brought
a cloud to his brow, and presently he said, almost
involuntarily: "How many misfortunes, how
much bitterness your mother suffered, with such
great resignation, such strength, such peace! Do
you believe that natural goodness alone would be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
able to suffer thus?" "I do not know," Luisa
replied. "I think poor Mamma must have lived
in a better world before she was born into this,
for her heart was always there." She did not say
all she thought. She thought that if all the good
souls on earth resembled her mother in religious
meekness, this world would become the kingdom
of the rascal and the tyrant. And as to ills, which
do not come from man, but from the very conditions
of human life itself, she felt greater admiration
for such as strive against them with their
own strength, than for such as invoke and obtain
aid from that same Being by whom the blow was
dealt. She would not confess these sentiments
to her husband, but instead, expressed the hope
that her uncle might never suffer deep affliction.
Could it be possible that the Lord would wish
such a man to suffer? "No, no, no!" Franco
exclaimed; at another moment he would not
perhaps have dared to admonish God in this
manner. A breath of the <i>Boglia</i> swept down the
ravine of Muzài, and rustled the top branches of
the walnut-trees. To Luisa that fluttering seemed
connected with Franco's last words; it seemed
to her that the wind and the great trees knew
something of the future, and were whispering
about it together.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
THE SECRET OF THE WIND AND<br />
THE WALNUT-TREES</h2>

<p>Maria's fever lasted only eight days; nevertheless,
when she left her bed, her parents
found her more changed in face and in mind than
if the eight days had been eight months. Her
eyes had grown darker, and had assumed a peculiar
expression of calm and precocious maturity.
She spoke more distinctly and rapidly, but to
those who were not to her liking, she would not
speak at all, would not even greet them. This
was more displeasing to Franco than to Luisa.
Franco wished her to be amiable, but Luisa
feared to spoil her sincerity. For her mother
Maria cherished an affection violent rather than
demonstrative, a jealous, almost fierce affection.
She was very fond of her father also, but it was
evident that she felt he was unlike herself. Franco
had passionate outbursts of affection for her,
when he would catch her up unexpectedly, press
her close, and cover her with kisses. At such
moments she would throw her head back, plant
one little hand upon her father's face, and look
frowningly at him, as if something in him were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
strange and repugnant to her. Often Franco
would scold her angrily, and Maria would cry and
stare at him through her tears, motionless, and as
if fascinated, and always wearing the expression
of one who does not understand. He noticed
the child's predilection for her mother, and this
was pleasing to him, for it seemed a just preference,
and he never doubted that later Maria
would love him tenderly also. Luisa, loving her
husband as she did, was much troubled that the
child should exhibit greater affection for herself;
however this sentiment of hers was less lively,
less pure, than Franco's generous pleasure. It
seemed to Luisa that, after all, in spite of his
transports, Franco loved his daughter as a being
distinct from himself, while she, who had no transports
of external tenderness, loved the child as a
vital part of herself. Moreover she cherished in
her heart a future Maria probably very different
from the one Franco cherished. For this reason
also she could not regret her moral ascendency over
her daughter. She foresaw the danger that Franco
might favour an exaggerated development of
the child's religious sentiment, and this, to her,
was a very serious danger, for in Maria, full of
curiosity, eager for stories, there were the germs
of a very lively imagination, which would be most
favourable to religious fancies, and a badly balanced
moral sense might be the result. It was
not a question of abolishing religious sentiment;
this Luisa, out of respect for Franco, if for no other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
reason, would never have sought to do, but it was
imperative that Maria, on reaching womanhood,
should be able to find the pivot of her own existence
in her own sure and vigorous moral sense, a
moral sense not founded upon beliefs which, after
all, were simply hypotheses and opinions, and
which, sooner or later, might fail her. The
preservation of faith in Justice and in Truth,
setting aside all other faith, all hope, all fear,
seemed to her the most sublime condition of the
human conscience. She believed that because
she went to Mass, and twice a year to the sacraments,
she had renounced such perfection for herself,
and she intended to renounce it for Maria
also, but as one who, finding himself hampered
by wife and children, must renounce Christian
perfection, but who does so unwillingly, and in as
slight a degree as possible.</p>

<p>Fate might bestow riches upon Maria. Therefore
they must carefully provide against her acceptance
of a life of frivolity, compensated for by the
giving of alms, the Mass in the morning, and the
rosary at night. On several occasions Luisa had
attempted to sound Franco upon the question of
giving Maria's education a moral direction quite
apart from the religious direction, but such attempts
had never been accompanied by satisfactory
results. Franco could understand an
unbelief in religion, but it was quite incomprehensible
to him that there were those who found
religion insufficient as a rule of life. He had never
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
for a moment believed that all should aspire to
saintliness, or that those who love <i>tarocchi</i>, primero,
hunting, fishing, nice little dinners and a bottle of
fine wine, are not good Christians. And this
moral direction in education as divided from the
religious direction seemed to him a mere notion,
because, to his thinking, all honest men who did
not believe, were honest either by nature or from
habit, and not from any moral or philosophical
reasoning. So it was not possible for Luisa to
come to an understanding with her husband on
this delicate point. She must act alone and very
cautiously, in order neither to offend nor to grieve
him. When Franco pointed out to the child the
stars and the moon, the flowers and the butterflies,
as admirable works of God, using poetically religious
language fit for a child of twelve, Luisa
held her peace; but if, on the contrary, he chanced
to say to Maria: "Mind, God does not wish you
to do that!" Luisa would immediately add:
"That is wicked! You must never do what is
wicked!" In such cases some dissension must
inevitably arise between the parents, for the moral
judgment of one was not always in harmony with
the moral judgment of the other. Once they
were standing together at the window of the hall,
while Maria played with a little girl of about her
own age from Oria. A brother of the child
passed, a tyrant of eight, and ordered his little
sister to follow him. She refused and wept.
But Maria, looking very grave, faced the tyrant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
with clenched fists. Franco restrained her by a
sharp command; the little one turned and looked
at him, and then burst into tears, while the tyrant
dragged his victim away. Luisa left the window,
saying in an undertone to her husband: "Excuse
me, but that was not just." "Why was it not
just?" said Franco, and he became heated and
raised his voice, demanding whether his wife
wished Maria to grow up pugilistic and violent.
She answered gently and firmly, overlooking
some sharp words of his, and maintaining that
Maria's impulse had been good; that our first
duty is to withstand tyranny and injustice; and
that, though the child use his fists, the man would
use more civilised weapons; but if the natural
impulse of the soul be repressed in the child, there
was danger of destroying the nascent sense of
justice as well.</p>

<p>Franco would not be convinced. According
to him it was very doubtful whether Maria had
harboured any such heroic sentiments. She had
simply been angry because she was to be deprived
of her playmate, that was all. Besides, was it
not a woman's place to oppose gentle meekness to
injustice and tyranny, to appease and correct the
offender, rather than repulse the offence by force?
Luisa flushed crimson, and replied that this rôle
might suit some women, perhaps the best of
women, but it would certainly not suit all, for not
all were so meek and humble.</p>

<p>"And you are of that number?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
    "I believe so."</p>

<p>"A fine thing to boast of!"</p>

<p>"Does it grieve you very much?"</p>

<p>"Very much indeed."</p>

<p>Luisa placed her hands on his shoulders. "Does
it grieve you very much," said she, "that I rebel
as you yourself do against the presence of these
masters in our house; that I desire as you yourself
do, to help, even with my hands, in driving
them out? Or would you prefer to see me attempt
to correct Radetzky and appease the
Croatians?"</p>

<p>"That is a different thing."</p>

<p>"In what way? No, it is the same thing."</p>

<p>"It is a different thing!" Franco repeated,
but he was unable to demonstrate this. He felt
he was wrong according to superficial ratiocination,
and right according to a profound truth which
he was unable to grasp. He said no more but
was thoughtful all day, and was evidently seeking
for an answer. He thought about it in the night
also, and finally, believing he had found an
answer, called to his wife, who was asleep.</p>

<p>"Luisa!" said he. "Luisa, that is a different
thing."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" Luisa exclaimed,
waking with a start.</p>

<p>He had reflected that the offence of a foreign
dominion was not personal like a private offence,
and was always the result of a violation of a principle
of universal justice. But while he was explaining
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
this to his wife it struck him that in
private offences also there was always the violation
of a principle of universal justice, and he
fancied he must have blundered.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said he.</p>

<p>His wife thought he was dreaming, and placing
her head upon his shoulder, she went to sleep
again. If any argument could convert Franco
to his wife's ideas it was this sweet contact, this
gentle breathing upon his breast, in which he had
so often and so deliciously felt the blending of
their two souls. But now it was not so. Through
his brain the thought flashed suddenly like a
quick and cold blade, that this latent antagonism
between his wife's views and his own might one
day burst forth in some painful form, and, terrified,
he pressed her in his arms, as if to defend
both himself and her against the phantoms of his
own brain.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After breakfast, on the sixth of November
Franco took his great gardening-shears and proceeded
as usual, to the extermination of all dry
leaves and branches on the terrace and in the
little garden. The great beauty and deep peace
of the hour went to the heart. Not a leaf stirred;
the air from the west was most pure and crystalline;
on the east the hills between Osteno and
Porlezza were fading against a background of
light mist; the house was glorious with the sun and
the tremulous reflections from the lake; but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
though the sun was still very hot, the chrysanthemums
in the little garden, the olives and laurels
along the coast&mdash;more plainly visible now among
the reddening, falling leaves&mdash;a certain secret
freshness in the air, scented with <i>olea fragrans</i>, the
absence of all wind, the vaporous mountains of
the Lake of Como, white with snow, all said, with
one melancholy accord, that the sweet season was
dying. When he had exterminated the withered
brushwood Franco proposed to his wife that they
should go to Casarico in their boat, and return the
two first volumes of the <i>Mystères du Peuple</i> which
they had eagerly devoured in a few days, to their
friend Gilardoni, and borrow the next volume
from him. They decided to start after lunch,
when Maria should have gone to bed. But before
Maria had been put to bed Barborin Pasotti
appeared, all out of breath, her bonnet and mantle
askew. She had come up from the garden-gate,
and now stopped on the threshold of the hall. It
was the first time she had been to see them since
the search. Upon catching sight of her friends
she clasped her hands, and kept repeating in a low
tone: "Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!"
Then she flung herself upon Luisa and covered her
with kisses.</p>

<p>"My dear girl! My dear girl!" she exclaimed.
She would have liked to treat Franco in the same
way, but Franco was not favourable to this sort
of emotion, and his expression was not encouraging,
so the poor woman had to be satisfied with taking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
both his hands and shaking them heartily. "My
dear Don Franco! My dear Don Franco!"
Finally she gathered Maria into her arms, but the
child planted her two little hands upon Barborin's
chest, her face wearing an expression
similar to her father's. "I am old, am I not?
And ugly? You don't like me? Well, never
mind, never mind!" And she fell to kissing the
child's arms and shoulders humbly, not daring to
brave the sour little face. Then she told her
friends she had brought them a piece of good news,
and her eyes sparkled at the pleasant mystery.
The Marchesa had written to Pasotti, and one
passage in the letter Barborin had committed to
memory. "It was with the deepest regret (deepest
regret, those were the very words) that I
learned of the sad affair at Oria ... at Oria
... (wait a moment) the sad affair at Oria
... (ah!) and although my grandson is most
undeserving (wait! ... have patience!)
I trust that it may have no unpleasant consequences."
The passage did not produce any
great effect. Luisa frowned and said nothing.
Franco glanced at his wife, and did not dare to
utter the favourable comment he had on his lips,
but not in his heart. Poor Barborin, who had
taken advantage of her husband's absence at
Lugano to run to her friends with this sugar-plum,
was deeply mortified, and after gazing ruefully
from Luisa to Franco, ended by pulling a real
sugar-plum from her pocket, and offering it to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Maria. Then, having made out that the Maironis
wanted to go away in the boat, and longing to be
allowed to stay with Maria a little while, she
begged and entreated so hard that they finally
started, leaving orders with Veronica to put the
child to bed a little later.</p>

<p>Maria did not seem any too well pleased with
the company of her elderly friend. She remained
silent, obstinately silent, and before long she
opened her mouth and burst into tears. Poor
Barborin did not know which Saint to appeal to,
so she appealed to Veronica, but Veronica was
discoursing with a customs-guard, and either did
not or would not hear. Barborin showed her
rings, her watch, even the big bonnet, <i>â la vice-reine
Beauharnais</i>, but nothing would do, and
Maria continued to weep. Then she bethought
her of going to the piano, where she strummed
eight or ten bars of an antediluvian jig over and
over again. Then little Princess Maria became
more amiable, and allowed her old court-pianist
to lift her as carefully as if her little arms had been
a butterfly's wings, and place her on her lap as
softly as if there had been danger of the old legs
crumbling to dust.</p>

<p>When the jig had been repeated five or six
times Maria began to look bored and tried to pull
the elderly pianist's hand from the key-board,
saying in an undertone: "Sing me a song."
Obtaining no answer, she turned, looked Barborin
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
straight in the face, and shouted at the top of her
voice: "Sing me a song."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," Barborin replied. "I
am deaf."</p>

<p>"Why are you deaf?"</p>

<p>"I am deaf," the unfortunate woman answered,
smiling.</p>

<p>"But why are you deaf?"</p>

<p>Barborin could not imagine what the child was
saying.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said she.</p>

<p>"Then you are stupid," Maria announced with
a very serious face, and knitting her brows, she
repeated in a whining voice: "I want a song!"</p>

<p>A voice from the little garden said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here is the person for songs."</p>

<p>Maria raised her head and her face became
radiant. "Missipipì!" she cried, and slipping down
from Barborin's lap, ran to meet Uncle Piero who
was coming in. Signora Pasotti rose also, astonished
and smiling, and stretched out her arms
towards this old and unexpected friend. "Behold,
behold, behold!" she exclaimed, and hastened
to greet him. Maria was calling so loudly for
"Missipipì, Missipipì!" and clinging so tight to
Uncle Piero's legs, that, although he did not seem
inclined to do so, he was obliged to sit down on
the sofa, take the child on his knees, and repeat
the old story to her.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proud shade of the river&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After four or five "Missipipìs" Signora Pasotti
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
went home, fearing her husband might return.
Veronica wished to put the child to bed, but the
little one rebelled, and Uncle Piero interfered,
saying: "Oh, leave her here a little while longer,"
and he took her out to the terrace to see if Papa
and Mamma were coming.</p>

<p>No boat could be seen coming from Casarico.
The little one ordered her uncle to sit down, and
then she climbed upon his knee.</p>

<p>"Why did you come?" said she. "There
isn't any dinner for you, you know."</p>

<p>"Then you must cook some for me. I came to
stay with you."</p>

<p>"Always?"</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>"But really always, always, always?"</p>

<p>"Really always."</p>

<p>Maria became silent and thoughtful, but presently
she asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What have you brought me?"</p>

<p>Uncle Piero drew a rubber doll from his pocket.
Had Maria known, had she been able to understand
how he had gone out to buy that doll for her
in great anguish of mind, still smarting from a
terrible blow, she would have wept with pity.</p>

<p>"This is an ugly present," said she, recalling
others he had brought her. "And if you stay
here will you never bring me any more presents?"</p>

<p>"No more presents."</p>

<p>"Go away, Uncle," said she.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
    And then Maria wanted her uncle to tell her if
his uncle had brought him presents when he was
a little boy. But, though the thing was inconceivable
to Maria, this uncle of her uncle had
never existed. Who had brought him presents,
then? And had he always been a good little boy?
Had he cried much? Her uncle began telling
her many tales of his childhood, things that had
happened sixty years before, when people wore
wigs and pig-tails. He enjoyed talking to his
little grand-niece of that far-away time, making
her share for a moment the existence of his dead
parents, and he spoke with sad gravity, as if the
dear ones who had passed away had been present,
and he were speaking more for them than for her.
She fixed her wide-open eyes on his face, and
gazed intently at him. Neither he nor she heeded
the flight of time, neither he nor she thought of
the boat that was coming.</p>

<p>And the boat came. Luisa and Franco drew
near, suspecting nothing, and believing the child
to be asleep. Franco was the first to perceive
Uncle Piero seated under the drooping branches
of the passion-flower vine with Maria on his knee.
He uttered a loud exclamation of surprise, and,
followed by Luisa, hastened towards them, fearing
something had happened. "You here?" he called
as he ran. Luisa, who was very pale, said nothing.
Uncle Piero raised his head, and looked at them.
They felt at once that he had brought bad news,
for they had never seen him so grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
    "<i>Addio!</i> God bless you!" said he.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" Franco whispered.
Uncle Piero motioned to them to withdraw
from the terrace to the loggia, whither he followed
them. Then the poor old man spread wide his
arms as one crucified, and said in a sad but firm
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am dismissed."</p>

<p>Franco and Luisa stared at him for a moment,
dazed. Then Franco burst out: "Oh, Uncle,
Uncle!" and fell upon his neck. Seeing her
father's action and the expression on her mother's
face Maria fell to sobbing. Luisa tried to pacify
her, but she herself, strong woman that she was,
felt the tears rising in her throat.</p>

<p>Seated on the sofa in the hall Uncle Piero told
them that the Imperial and Royal Delegate of
Como had sent for him to tell him that the search
which had been carried out in his house at Oria
had given painful and unexpected results, but
what these results were he had positively refused
to state. The Delegate had added that the
authorities had at first intended to take legal proceedings
against him, but that in consideration of
his long and faithful services to the government,
it had been decided to remove him from office
instead. Uncle Piero had insisted upon knowing
the nature of the accusations brought against him,
but the Delegate had dismissed him without an
answer.</p>

<p>"And what is to be done now?" said Franco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
    "What is to be done&mdash;&mdash;" Uncle Piero was
silent for a moment, and then pronounced that
sacramental phrase of unknown origin which he
and his fellow <i>tarocchi</i> players were in the habit of
repeating when the game was hopelessly lost.
"We are done brown, O Queen!"</p>

<p>A long silence ensued, which was finally broken
by Luisa, who cast herself upon her uncle's neck,
murmuring: "Oh, Uncle, Uncle! I am afraid
it is our fault." She was thinking of the
grandmother, but Uncle Piero thought she
was accusing Franco and herself of some imprudence.</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear friends," said he good-naturedly,
but in his tone there was a hidden
spirit of reproof, "these discourses are useless.
Now that the evil is done we must think of bread.
You may count upon this house, upon some
modest savings which bring me in about four
<i>svanziche</i> a day, and upon two more mouths to
feed, mine and Cia's. Let us hope you will not
have to feed mine long." Franco and Luisa protested.
"Better so, better so!" Uncle Piero
exclaimed, waving his arms as if in contempt of
unreasonable sentimentality. "Live well, and
die in good time. That is the best rule. I have
performed the first part, now I must perform the
second. Meanwhile send some water to my room,
and open my bag. You will find ten meat croquettes,
which Signora Carolina dell'Agria insisted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
upon giving me. You see we are not so badly off,
after all!"</p>

<p>Whereupon Uncle Piero rose and went out at
the drawing-room door with a firm step, and even
when his back was turned, displaying a head and
body held erect, and an unruffled serenity like
that of an ancient philosopher.</p>

<p>Franco, with knitted brows and arms crossed
upon his breast, was standing motionless on the
edge of the terrace, and looking towards Cressogno.
If at that moment he had had a bundle
of Delegates, Commissaries, police-agents, and
spies between his teeth, he would have ground
them so hard that all these functionaries would
have been reduced to pulp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE TRUMP CARD APPEARS</h2>

<p>"The boat is ready," said Ismaele, coming in
unceremoniously, his pipe in his left hand,
a lantern in his right.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" Franco asked.</p>

<p>"Half-past eleven."</p>

<p>"And the weather?"</p>

<p>"It is snowing."</p>

<p>"That is good!" Uncle Piero exclaimed ironically,
stretching his legs towards the flames of
the juniper bush that was crackling in the little
fireplace.</p>

<p>In the small parlour, arranged for winter, Luisa,
on her knees, was tying a muffler round Maria's
neck. Franco, holding his wife's cape, stood
waiting while the old housekeeper, her bonnet on
and her hands buried in her muff, was grumbling
at her master. "What a man you are! What
are you going to do all alone here at home?"</p>

<p>"I don't need any one when I am asleep," the
engineer answered. "Other people may be mad,
but I am not. Put my milk and the lamp here."</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve and the mad idea these
otherwise sane people had conceived, the determination
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
which seemed so incomprehensible to
Uncle Piero, was to go to the solemn Midnight-Mass
at S. Mamette.</p>

<p>"And that innocent victim also!" said he,
glancing at the child.</p>

<p>Franco flushed hotly, and declared that he
wished to prepare precious memories for her. He
believed this excursion at night, in the boat, on
the dark lake, the snow, the crowded and brightly
lighted church, the organ, the singing, the holy
associations of Christmas, would prove to be such.
He spoke with heat, perhaps not so much for the
uncle as for some one who was silent.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," said Uncle Piero, as if he had
expected this rhetoric, this useless poetry.</p>

<p>"I am going to have some punch, too, you
know!" said the child. The uncle smiled.
"That is not bad! That will indeed form a precious
memory!" Franco frowned at beholding
his frail structure of poetical and religious memories
thus demolished.</p>

<p>"And Gilardoni?" Luisa asked.</p>

<p>"Here they are now," Ismaele said, going out
with his lantern.</p>

<p>Professor Gilardoni had invited the Maironis
and Donna Ester Bianchi to come to his house for
punch after Mass. He was now expected from
Niscioree, whither he had gone to fetch the young
lady, who had lived there alone with two maid-servants
since her father's death, which had taken
place in 1852. The worthy Professor had mourned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
secretly for Signora Teresa for a reasonable length
of time, but during the convalescence of his heart,
which kept him weak and languid, and in permanent
danger of a relapse, he had not been careful
enough of the merry little face, the lively eyes,
and sparkling gaiety of the little Princess of
Niscioree, as the Maironis called Donna Ester.</p>

<p>At seven-and-twenty Donna Ester looked like
a girl of twenty, save in her movements there was
a certain languor, and in her eyes a certain delicious
hidden knowledge. She had not intended
to fish for this respectable lover, but now she
knew he was caught, and she was pleased, believing
him to be a man of great genius, and
infinite wisdom. That he should ever dare speak
to her of love, that she might marry all this sallow,
wrinkled, dry knowledge, had never entered
her head. Nevertheless she did not wish to
quench this little fire, which was so discreet, which
was an honour to her, and probably a source of
happiness to him. If she sometimes laughed
about him with Luisa she was never the first to
laugh, and always hastened to repeat: "Poor
Signor Gilardoni! Poor Professor!"</p>

<p>She came in hastily, her fair head enveloped in
a great black hood, looking like Spring out on the
spree disguised as December. December was
close behind her, his neck shrouded in a great
scarf, above which rose the red and shining professorial
nose, irritated by the snow. As it was
already late they immediately took leave of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Uncle Piero, who was left alone with his milk
and his lamp before the dying embers of the
juniper-bush.</p>

<p>A slight shadow of disapproval still rested on
his face. Franco was playing the poet too much.
Nowadays life was hard at Casa Maironi. Breakfast
consisted of a cup of milk and chicory-coffee,
and they used a sort of reddish sugar that tasted
of the chemist's shop. They indulged in meat
only on Thursdays and Sundays. A bottle of
Grimelli wine appeared on the table regularly
every day for Uncle Piero, who rebelled against
being the privileged one. Every day clouds
gathered around this bottle and a little storm
burst forth, which, however, always ended as
Uncle Piero wished, in a short shower of the decoction
into each of the five glasses. The servant
had been dismissed, and only Veronica remained
to do the heavy work, stir the <i>polenta</i>, and sometimes
look after Maria. But in spite of these
and other economies Luisa could not make both
ends meet, though Cia had refused to accept any
wages, and gifts of curds, of <i>mascherpa</i>, of goats'-cheeses,
of chestnuts and walnuts were always
pouring in upon them from the townspeople.
She had obtained some copying from a notary at
Porlezza, but it was hard work for miserable pay.
Franco had also begun to copy diligently, but he
accomplished less than his wife and, moreover,
there was not work enough for two. He should
have bestirred himself, have sought some private
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
employment, but Uncle Piero saw no signs of this,
and so&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>And so this thinking about poetic expeditions
seemed to him more out of place than ever. After
having pondered a long time upon their sad plight,
and upon the slender probability that Franco
would ever be able to extricate them from it, he
reflected that, for him, the first thing to do was to
drink his milk, and the second, to go to bed.
But another thought came to him. He opened
the hall-door, and seeing the room was quite dark,
went into the kitchen, lighted a lantern, and
carried it to the loggia, where he opened one of the
windows. Although it was snowing there was no
wind, so he placed the lantern on the window-sill,
that its light might help those poetic people to
steer their homeward course over the dark lake.</p>

<p>Then he went to bed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Ismaele brought his freight safely to S. Mamette
in the covered boat. The snow was still falling
placidly in big flakes. The church was already
quite full, and even the ladies were obliged to
stand, behind the first row of benches. Ester
volunteered to look after Maria, and lifted her to
a seat on top of the bench in front of them, while
the sacristan was busy lighting the candles on the
high-altar. Cia was tormenting the Professor,
whom she believed to be a pious man, with a
thousand questions concerning the difference
between the Roman and Ambrosian rites, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Maria was keeping Ester busy with still more
puzzling questions.</p>

<p>"Who are they lighting those candles for?"</p>

<p>"For our Lord."</p>

<p>"Is our Lord going to bed now?"</p>

<p>"No, hush!"</p>

<p>"And has the <i>bambino Gesu</i>&mdash;the child Jesus&mdash;gone
to bed already?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Ester replied thoughtlessly, to put
an end to these questions.</p>

<p>"With the mule?"</p>

<p>Once Uncle Piero had brought Maria an ugly,
little wooden mule which she detested, and when
she was obstinate and capricious her mother
would put her to bed with the mule under her
pillow, under her obstinate little head.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, chatterbox!" said Ester.</p>

<p>"I don't go to bed with the mule. I say <i>excuse
me</i>!"</p>

<p>"Hush! Listen to the organ."</p>

<p>All the candles were now lighted, and the
organist having mounted to his post, was teasing
his old instrument as if to waken it, drawing from
it what seemed to be angry grunts. When, on
the ringing of a bell, the organ poured forth all its
great voice, and the altar-boys and the priest
appeared, Luisa stole her hand into her husband's,
as if they had still been lovers.</p>

<p>Those two hands pressing each other furtively
were speaking of a fast approaching event, of a
serious resolve which must be kept a secret, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
which was not yet formed irrevocably. The
little nervous hand said: "Have courage!" The
manly hand said: "I will!" They must indeed
make up their minds to it. Franco must go away,
leave his wife, his child, and the old man, perhaps
for some months, perhaps for some years. He
must leave Valsolda, the dear little house, his
flowers, perhaps for ever. He must emigrate to
Piedmont, seek for work and gain, in the hope of
being able to call his family to him in case that
other great national hope should not be realised.
He was glad his wife had chosen this solemn
place and hour in which to encourage him in his
sacrifice, and he did not drop the gentle hand, but
held it as a lover might, never looking at Luisa,
his face and person immovable. He spoke with
his hand only, with his soul in palm and fingers, he
spoke the most varied, passionate language, consisting
of soft caresses, of embraces, of tenderness
and ardour. From time to time she would endeavour
to gently withdraw her hand, and then
he would clasp it violently. His gaze was fixed
on the altar, and he held his head erect as if
absorbed in the music of the organ, in the voice
of the priest, in the singing of the congregation.
As a matter of fact he was not following the
prayers, but he felt the Divine Presence, was
experiencing an ecstasy, a fervour of love, of pain,
of hope in God. Luisa had taken his hand in the
belief that he was praying, that all his fears, all
his doubts were stirring in his soul. She had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
indeed wished to inspire him with courage, convinced
that this painful step was best for him.
She only half understood the pressure that
answered her; it seemed to her a passionate protest
against this separation, and although this
was most sweet to her, she could not approve of it,
and so from time to time she strove to withdraw
her hand. At the moment of the Elevation it was
he who withdrew his, out of respect. Then he
was obliged to take Maria in his arms, for she had
fallen asleep, and slept on, her head on her father's
shoulder, displaying half of a little, peaceful face.
She, his darling, did not know that her father was
going so far away, and his heart was filled with
tender yearning towards that little, warm treasure,
which breathed upon it, towards that tiny head,
which had the perfume of a little wild bird. He
imagined himself already gone, imagined that
she was seeking for him, was crying, and then a
desire to press her closer ran through his arms, a
desire he quickly checked for fear of waking her.</p>

<p>It had stopped snowing when they left the
church.</p>

<p>"Wind! Wind!" said Ismaele, coming towards
them.</p>

<p>"I shall walk! I shall walk!" groaned Cia,
who had a great horror of the lake. Meanwhile
the crowd issuing from the church pushed and
dispersed the group, and carried them down the
steps. The six travellers and the boatmen met
again in the square of S. Mamette and here Donna
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Ester declared that, as she was not feeling very
well, she must forego the punch, and that she
would walk home with Cia.</p>

<p>Franco, Luisa, and the Professor saw it would
be useless to insist, and the two women started
towards Oria escorted by Ismaele, who was to
come back for the Maironis and the boat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A <i>moderateur</i> lamp illumined Gilardoni's salon,
a good fire was burning on the hearth, and Pinella
had prepared everything for the punch over which
Luisa presided, the host himself being much depressed
in spirit by Donna Ester's desertion.</p>

<p>"Look at Maria," said Franco softly.</p>

<p>The little one had gone to sleep in the Professor's
armchair near the window. Franco took
the lamp and held it aloft in order to see her
better. She seemed like some little creature
descended from heaven, fallen there with the star-light,
unconscious, her face suffused with a sweetness
which was not of this world, with a solemnity
full of mystery. "Darling!" said he, and drew
his wife towards him with an encircling arm, his
eyes still fixed on Maria. Gilardoni came up
behind them, and murmured: "How lovely!"
Then he went back to the fireplace sighing:
"Happy people!"</p>

<p>Franco, who was deeply moved, whispered in
his wife's ear: "Shall we tell him?" She did
not understand, and looked questioningly into
his eyes. "That I am going away," said he, still
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
in an undertone. Luisa started and answered,
"Yes, yes!" She was greatly affected, for she had
not expected this. In the church she had believed
he was still undecided. Her astonishment
did not escape Franco. He was troubled by it
and felt his resolution shaken, but she at once
perceived this, and repeated earnestly: "Yes,
yes!" and gently pushed him towards Gilardoni.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," said he, "I have something to
tell you."</p>

<p>The Professor, absorbed in contemplation of the
fire, did not answer. Franco placed a hand on
his shoulder. "Ah!" he exclaimed, rousing himself,
"I beg your pardon! What it is?"</p>

<p>"I wish to commend some one to your care."</p>

<p>"To my care? Who is it?"</p>

<p>"An old man, a woman, and a little child."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other in silence, one
deeply moved, the other amazed.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?" Luisa whispered.</p>

<p>No, he neither understood nor answered.</p>

<p>"I commend my wife, my daughter, and the
old uncle to your care," Franco replied.</p>

<p>"Oh!" the Professor exclaimed, looking in
astonishment from one to the other.</p>

<p>"I am going away," said Franco, with a smile
that went to Gilardoni's heart. "We have not
told Uncle Piero yet, but I must go. In our position
I cannot stay here doing nothing. I shall
say I am going to Milan, and those who will may
believe it, but I shall really be in Piedmont."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
    Gilardoni clasped his hands in silent amazement.
Luisa embraced Franco and kissed him,
holding his head upon her breast, her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>The Professor imagined it was painful to her to
bow to her husband's will in this matter.</p>

<p>"Now listen to me," said he, addressing Franco.
"If war had broken out I could understand your
going, but as it is, I think you do wrong to cause
your wife so much suffering for a question of
money."</p>

<p>Luisa who was still clinging with one arm to her
husband's neck, motioned to Professor Gilardoni
with the other hand, entreating him to be silent.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" she murmured, once more clasping
her arms about Franco. "You are doing
right! You are doing right!" As Gilardoni
continued to insist, she drew away from her husband,
and cried, her hands extended protestingly
towards their host: "But, Professor, it is I who
tell him he is doing right! I, his wife, tell him
so! Dear Professor, don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"After all, dear lady," Gilardoni burst out,
"it is time you were informed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Franco flung his arms towards him, crying
impetuously: "Professor!"</p>

<p>"You are doing wrong," the other replied.
"You are doing wrong, very wrong!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Franco?" Luisa demanded in
astonishment. "Is there something I do not
know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
    "Only that I must go away, that I shall go
away. That is all!"</p>

<p>Franco's exclamation, "Professor!" had awakened
Maria with a start. Seeing her mother's
agitation she prepared to cry; presently she burst
into violent sobbing, and wailed: "No Papa!
Papa not go away! Not go away!"</p>

<p>Franco took her in his arms, kissing and caressing
her, while she kept repeating: "My Papa!
My Papa!" in a pitiful, grieved voice that made
their hearts ache. Her father yearned over her,
and protested that he would always stay with her;
but he wept at his own deceit, wept with the
emotion this new tenderness, springing up at
such a moment, caused him.</p>

<p>Luisa was thinking of her husband's cry.
Gilardoni saw she suspected a secret, and, hoping
to distract her thoughts, asked her if Franco intended
to start at once. Franco himself replied.
Everything depended upon a letter from Turin.
Perhaps it would be a week, at the latest a fortnight,
before he started. Luisa was silent, and
the subject was dropped. Then Franco talked
of politics, of the probability that war would
break out in the Spring. But again conversation
soon languished. Gilardoni and Luisa seemed to
be thinking of something else, to be listening to
the beat of the waves against the garden wall.
Finally Ismaele returned, drank his punch, and
assured them that the lake was not very rough,
and that they could start homewards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
    As soon as the Maironis were seated in the
boat, and Maria had gone to sleep, Luisa asked
her husband if there was something she did not
know, and which Gilardoni must not tell.</p>

<p>Franco did not answer.</p>

<p>"Enough!" said she. Then her husband threw
his arm around her neck and pressed her to him,
protesting against words she had not uttered.
"Oh, Luisa, Luisa!"</p>

<p>Luisa suffered his embrace, but did not return
it, and at last, in despair, her husband promised
to tell her every thing, at once. "Do you think
I am curious?" she whispered, in his arms. No,
no. He would tell her at once, tell her everything;
he would explain why he had not spoken before.
She did not wish this; she preferred that he
should speak at some other time, and of his own
free will.</p>

<p>The wind was in their favour and the light
shining in the window of the loggia served Ismaele
well as a guide. Franco's arm still encircled his
wife's shoulders, and his gaze was fixed upon that
shining point. Neither he nor she thought of the
loving and prudent hand that had lighted it.
But Ismaele thought of it, and reflected that
neither Veronica nor Cia were capable of such an
act of genius, and blessed the engineer's kind
heart.</p>

<p>On leaving the boat Maria woke up, and her
parents seemed to have no thought save for her.
When they were in bed Franco put out the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
    "It concerns my grandmother," said he in a
broken and agitated voice. "Poor boy!" Luisa
murmured and took his hand affectionately. "I
have never told you in order to avoid accusing
my grandmother, and also because&mdash;&mdash;" He
paused, and then it was he who mingled with his
words the most tender caresses, to which Luisa
now no longer responded. "I feared your impressions,
your sentiments, the ideas you might
conceive&mdash;&mdash;!" As his words began to express
his doubts his voice grew more tender.</p>

<p>Luisa felt the approach, not of a dispute, but
of a far more lasting disagreement. Now, she no
longer wished her husband to speak, and he,
noticing her increasing coldness, did not continue.
She rested her forehead against his shoulder, and
said, almost in spite of herself: "Tell me!"</p>

<p>Then Franco, his lips against her hair, related
the story the Professor had told him on the night
of their marriage. In repeating from memory
the contents of his grandfather's letter and will,
he greatly softened the injurious expressions used
against his father and grandmother. In the
middle of his recital Luisa, who had not expected
such a revelation, raised her head from her husband's
shoulder. He stopped. "Go on," said
she.</p>

<p>When he had finished she asked if there was any
proof that his grandfather's will had been suppressed.
Franco promptly answered that there
was not. "Then," said she, "why did you speak
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of the ideas I might conceive?" Her thoughts
had immediately flown to the probability of his
grandmother's crime, to the possibility of a prosecution.
But if prosecution were not possible?</p>

<p>Franco did not answer, and she exclaimed, after
a moment's reflection, "Ah! the copy of the will!
Could that be used? Would that be valid?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you would not use it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not, Franco?"</p>

<p>"There!" Franco exclaimed. "You see? I
knew you would say so! No, I will not make use
of it! No, no, never!"</p>

<p>"But what reasons have you for not doing so?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! My reasons! My reasons can be
felt. You should feel them without my having
to explain them."</p>

<p>"I do not feel them. Don't imagine I am
thinking of the money. We will not touch the
money. Give it to whomever you like; I feel
the claims of justice. There are your grandfather's
wishes to be respected; there is the crime
your grandmother has committed. You who
are so religious should perceive that Divine
Justice has brought this document to light. Would
you place yourself between this woman and
Divine Justice?"</p>

<p>"Let Divine Justice alone," Franco retorted,
hotly. "What do we know of the ways of Divine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Justice? There is also Divine Mercy. She is my
father's mother, think of that! And have I not
always despised this accursed money? What
did I do when my grandmother threatened not to
leave me a penny if I married you?"</p>

<p>Unable to speak, he drew Luisa's head to his
breast.</p>

<p>"I despised the money for your sake," he went
on in a stifled voice. "Would you have me try
to regain it now by going to law?"</p>

<p>"No indeed!" Luisa broke in, raising her
head. "You may give the money to whomever
you wish. I am talking of justice. Don't you
also feel the demand of justice?"</p>

<p>"<i>Dio mio!</i>" said he, with a deep sigh. "It
would have been better if I had not spoken to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps. If you were bound never to
alter your decision, it would perhaps have been
wiser."</p>

<p>Luisa's voice expressed sadness, not anger, as
she uttered these words.</p>

<p>"In any way, that document no longer exists,"
Franco remarked.</p>

<p>Luisa started. "It no longer exists?" said she
anxiously, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"No. The Professor was to destroy it, by my
orders."</p>

<p>A long silence followed. Very slowly Luisa
withdrew her head and rested it on her own pillow.
Suddenly Franco exclaimed, aloud: "A law-suit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
indeed! With those documents! With
those insults! To the mother of my father! And
all for money!"</p>

<p>"Don't keep repeating that," his wife exclaimed
indignantly. "Why do you keep repeating
that? Don't you know very well it is
not true?"</p>

<p>Both spoke excitedly. It was plain that during
the preceding silence their thoughts had been hard
at work on this point. The reproof irritated him,
and he replied blindly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Franco!" cried Luisa, much hurt. He
already regretted the affront, and begged her to
forgive him, accusing his hot temper, which made
him say things he did not mean, and he entreated
her to speak a kind word to him. "Yes, yes,"
Luisa answered with a sigh, but he was not satisfied,
and wished her to embrace him and say,
"I forgive you." The touch of the dear lips did
not refresh him as usual. Some minutes passed,
and then he strained his ear to hear if his wife had
fallen asleep. He heard the wind, Maria's quiet
breathing, the noise of the waves, the jarring of
a window, but that was all. "Have you really
forgiven me?" he whispered, and he heard her
soft answer: "Yes, dear." Presently she, in
her turn, listened, and besides the wind, the waves,
the creaking of a shutter, the even, regular breathing
of the child, she heard the even, regular
breathing of her husband. Then she once more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
sighed deeply, sighed despairingly. Oh, God!
How could Franco have acted thus? What
wounded her heart most sorely was the fact that he
did not seem to sense the injuries which her poor
mother and Uncle Piero had suffered. But she
would not allow herself to dwell on this thought,
at least not until she had considered his other
mistake, his mistaken idea of justice. And here
she felt bitterly, but not without a certain satisfaction,
that he was her inferior, that he was controlled
by sentiments that were the outcome of
his fancy, while her own sentiment was inspired by
reason. Franco had in him so much of the child.
He had, even now, been able to go to sleep, while
she was sure of not closing her eyes all night long.
She believed she was without imagination because
she did not feel it move, because in her it was less
easily inflamed. She would have laughed had
she been told that imagination was more powerful
in her than in her husband. But indeed such
was the case. Only, in order to demonstrate
this, both souls must be turned upside down, for
Franco's imagination was visible on the surface of
his soul, and all his reason was at the bottom,
while in Luisa's soul imagination was at the bottom,
and reason was plainly visible on the surface.
In fact, she did not sleep, but all night long she
thought, with that imagination that lay at the
bottom of her soul, how religion favours weak
sentimentality, how incapable it is, even while
preaching the thirst for justice, of forming a correct
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
sense of justice in those intellects which are
devoted to it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Professor also, who was subject to serious
infiltrations of imagination into the ratiocinative
cells of his brain, as well as into the amorous cells
of his heart, having put out the light, spent the
greater part of the night in front of the fireplace,
working with the tongs and with his imagination,
taking up, examining and then dropping embers
and projects, until only one glowing coal and one
last idea remained. Then he took a match, and
having held it in contact with the ember, lighted
the lamp once more, seized the idea, which was
also hot and luminous, and carried it off to bed
with him.</p>

<p>This was the idea. He would start secretly
for Brescia, present himself before the Marchesa
with the terrible document, and obtain a capitulation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE PROFESSOR PLAYS HIS TRUMP<br />
CARD</h2>

<p>Three days later, in Milan, at five o'clock in
the morning, Professor Gilardoni, muffled
up to the eyes, issued from the Albergo degli
Angeli, passed in front of the cathedral, turned
into the dark street called dei Rastrelli behind a
line of horses led by postilions, and entered the
booking office of the public coaches. The little
courtyard where the post-office now stands, was
already full of people, of horses, of lanterns. To
the hermit of Valsolda all these voices of postilions
and of guards, this stamping of horses and jingling
of bells, seemed like a real pandemonium.</p>

<p>The horses were being harnessed to two coaches,
four to each. The Professor was going to Lodi
because he had learned that the Marchesa was
visiting a friend there, and the Lodi coach would
start at half-past five.</p>

<p>It was intensely cold, and the poor Professor
wandered anxiously around the ungainly carriage,
stamping his feet to warm them, until presently
another traveller said jestingly to him: "Cool,
is it not?" "Just a little fresh! Just a little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
fresh!" The horses were harnessed at last, an
employé called the passengers by name, and the
worthy Beniamino disappeared within the bowels
of the huge vehicle, together with two priests, an
old woman servant, an elderly gentleman with an
enormous wart on his face, and a fashionably
dressed young man. The doors were closed, an
order was given, the bells jingled, the huge vehicle
shook itself, the priests, the old woman, and the
gentleman with the wart crossed themselves, the
horses' sixteen hoofs rattled under the portal,
the massive wheels rumbled through it, and then
all this noise grew fainter as the coach turned to
the right, towards Porta Romana.</p>

<p>Now the wheels revolved almost noiselessly,
and the travellers heard only the irregular beat
of the sixteen hoofs on the stones. The Professor
watched the passing of dark houses, the pale
glow of infrequent street lamps, the flashing light
from some small coffee-house, or a vanishing
sentry-box.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the presence of these
soldiers lent something threatening, something so
formidable to the silence of the great city, that the
very walls of the houses were black with hatred.
When the coach entered the Corso di Porta
Romana, so filled with fog that he could hardly
see out of the window, he closed his eyes, and gave
himself up to the pleasure of thinking of and conversing
with the things and persons that filled
his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
    It was no longer the passenger with the wart
who sat opposite him, but Donna Ester, all enveloped
in a great black cape, a broad-brimmed hat
upon her head. She was looking at him fixedly,
and her lovely eyes were saying: "Well done!
You are acting nobly! Showing a great heart.
I would not have believed it! I admire you! To
me you are no longer old and ugly. Courage!"
At this exhortation to have courage, he was
seized with fear, for the image of the Marchesa
rose before him, and the dull rumble of the wheels
became the old lady's nasal voice, saying:
"Won't you sit down? What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>At this point the coach stopped and the Professor
opened his eyes. Porta Romana. An
official opened the door and asked for the passports
and having collected them, carried them away.
Returning again in about five minutes, he restored
their passports to all the passengers save
the fashionably dressed young man. To him
he said sharply: "Come with me." The young
man turned pale, but got out in silence and did
not return. In a moment or two the door was
closed, and a rough voice cried: "<i>Avanti!</i>"
The gentleman with the wart placed his travelling-bag
on the seat that was now vacant, but none of
the other passengers gave any sign of having
noticed what had happened. Only when the
four horses had once more begun to trot did
Gilardoni ask the priest, his neighbour, if he knew
the young man's name, but the priest's only
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
answer was a cross grunt, as he turned two terrified
and suspicious eyes upon the Professor. Beniamino
now looked towards the other priest, who
immediately drew a rosary from his pocket and,
having made the sign of the cross, began to pray.
Once more the Professor closed his eyes, and the
image of the unknown young man was lost for
ever in the mist, like the few and phantom-like
trees, the poplars and willows, slipping past on
either side of the road.</p>

<p>"How shall I begin?" thought Gilardoni.
Ever since Christmas Eve he had done nothing
but imagine and debate within himself how he
should present himself before the Marchesa, how
introduce the subject, how explain it, and what
terms he should offer. This was the only point on
which he was clear. If the Marchesa would make
her grandson a liberal allowance, he would
destroy the documents. He had not brought
them with him, but he had copies of them. Their
effect would surely be tremendous, but how
should he begin? Not one of the many preambles
he had thought of satisfied him. Even now with
closed eyes and fancy hard at work, he was considering
the question, starting from the only
known factor: "Take a seat. What can I do
for you?" But invariably his answer would appear
to him either too obsequious or too daring,
too remote from the subject or too close to it, and
he would once more go back to the beginning.
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
    The pale light of dawn, dreary, sad, and sleepy,
invaded the coach. Now that the time for the
interview was approaching, a thousand doubts,
a thousand fresh uncertainties upset all the Professor's
plans. The very base of his calculations
suddenly collapsed. What if the Marchesa should
not say either, "Take a seat," or "What can I do
for you?" What if she should receive him in
some other embarrassing manner? And what if
she should not receive him at all! Merciful
heavens! What then? The sudden ringing of
the sixteen hoofs on a paved way set his heart to
beating. However, it was not yet the streets of
Lodi, but those of Melegnano.</p>

<p>He reached Lodi at about nine o'clock, and got
out at the Albergo del Sole, where they gave him
a room without fire or sun. Not daring to brave
either the fog in the street or the fumes in the
kitchen, he decided to go to bed, and putting on
his night-cap, which was acquainted with all his
woes, he waited, a camphor cigarette between his
lips, for the coming of noon and a happy thought.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At one o'clock he ascended the steps of the
Palazzo X. with the wise determination to carefully
forget all the speeches he had prepared, and
to trust to the inspiration of the moment. A
footman in a white tie ushered him into a large,
dark apartment, with a brick floor, walls hung with
yellow silk, and a stuccoed ceiling, and having
bowed respectfully, went away. A few antique,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
white and gilt armchairs covered with red damask
stood in a semicircle before the fireplace, where
three or four enormous logs were burning slowly,
behind the brass fender. The air was laden with
the mixed odours of ancient mould, ancient cakes,
ancient stuffs, ancient leather, and decrepit ideas,
the whole forming a subtle essence of old age
enough to shrivel the very soul.</p>

<p>The servant reappeared and announced, to
Gilardoni's utter confusion, the imminent arrival
of the Signora Marchesa. He waited and waited,
and at last a great door, ornamented with gilding,
swung open, a little moving bell tinkled, Friend
trotted in, sniffing the floor to right and left, and
was followed by a great bell-shaped mass of black
silk, under a small cupola of white lace, while,
between two blue ribbons, appeared the black
wig, the marble brow, the lifeless eyes of the
Marchesa herself.</p>

<p>"What miracle! The Professor in Lodi!"
said the drowsy voice, while the small dog sniffed
at the Professor's boots. Gilardoni made a low
bow, and the lady, who might have been the jar
containing the essence of old age, seated herself
on one of the chairs near the fire, and installed
her lap-dog on another; after which she motioned
to Gilardoni to be seated also. "I suppose,"
said she, "that you have some relative at the
convent of the 'Dame Inglese'?"</p>

<p>"No," the Professor replied, "I have not."</p>

<p>Sometimes the Marchesa was facetious in her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
own way. "Then," said she, "you probably
came for a supply of <i>mascherponi</i>."<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>"Not for that either, Signora Marchesa. I
came on business."</p>

<p>"Indeed. You are unfortunate in the weather.
I believe it is raining now."</p>

<p>At this unexpected digression the Professor
came near losing his bearings. "Yes," said he,
feeling that he was growing foolish, like the
scholar whose examination is taking a bad turn.
"It is drizzling."</p>

<p>His voice, his expression, could not fail to
reveal his inward embarrassment, to show the
Marchesa that he had come to tell her something
important. However, she carefully avoided helping
him to unburden himself, and continued to
talk of the weather, the cold, the dampness, a
catarrh from which Friend was suffering, while
the dog punctuated his mistress's recital with
frequent sneezes.</p>

<p>The drowsy voice had a calm, almost jocose
inflection, a sort of bland benevolence, and the
Professor was bathed in cold sweat at the bare
thought of checking this mellifluous flow, and
offering in exchange the bitter pill he had in his
pocket. He might have taken advantage of a
pause to pour forth his preamble, but he was not
equal to it, and it was the Marchesa who seized
the opportunity to close the interview.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
    "I thank you very much for your visit," said
she, "and now I am going to dismiss you, for you
have your business to attend to, and, to tell the
truth, I also have an engagement."</p>

<p>Now or never he must take the leap.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," Gilardoni began, greatly
agitated, "I came to Lodi to speak with you,
Signora Marchesa."</p>

<p>"I should never have been able to guess that,"
said the lady frigidly.</p>

<p>The Professor was carried forward by the impetus
of his daring.</p>

<p>"It is a most urgent matter," said he, "and I
must beg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it is a matter of business, you must apply to
my agent in Brescia."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Signora Marchesa, it is really a
most important affair. No one knows and no
one must know that I have come to see you. I will
tell you at once that it concerns your grandson."</p>

<p>The Marchesa rose, and the dog that had been
crouching in the armchair also sprang up, barking
in Gilardoni's direction.</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me of that person who no
longer exists for me," the old lady said solemnly.
"Come, Friend!"</p>

<p>"No, Signora Marchesa," the Professor protested.
"You cannot possibly imagine what I
have to tell you."</p>

<p>"I do not in the least care to know. I do not
wish to hear anything. Good-day to you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
    Whereupon the inflexible old lady moved
towards the door.</p>

<p>"Marchesa!" Beniamino called after her,
while Friend, who had jumped from the chair,
barked furiously around his legs. "It concerns
your husband's will!"</p>

<p>This time the Marchesa could not but stop.
She did not, however, turn round.</p>

<p>"This will cannot be pleasing to you," Gilardoni
added rapidly. "But I have no intention of
publishing it. I entreat you to listen to me,
Marchesa."</p>

<p>She turned round. Her impenetrable face
betrayed a certain emotion in the quivering of the
nostrils. Nor were the shoulders entirely at rest.</p>

<p>"What tales have you to tell?" she retorted.
"Do you think it fitting to thus inconsiderately
mention my poor Franco to me? How dare you
meddle with my family affairs?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," the Professor repeated, searching
in his pocket. "If I do not meddle some one
else may do so even less considerately. Kindly
examine these documents. These&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your scribblings to yourself," the
Marchesa interrupted, seeing him draw some papers
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"These are copies I have made&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you to keep them, to take them away!"</p>

<p>The Marchesa rang the bell, and once more
started to leave the room.</p>

<p>Gilardoni, quivering with excitement, hearing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the approaching steps of a servant, and seeing her
about to open the door, threw his documents
upon one of the armchairs, saying hastily, in an
undertone: "I will leave them here. Let no one
see them. I am staying at the Sole, and will
return to-morrow. Examine the papers, and
think over them carefully!" And before the
servant arrived he had rushed out at the same
door by which he had entered, had seized his
heavy cape, and fled downstairs.</p>

<p>The Marchesa dismissed the footman, and stood
listening for a few moments. Then she retraced
her steps, took up the papers, and went to her
room, locking her door behind her. Having put
on her spectacles she took her stand near the
window, and began to read. Her brow was
clouded and her hands trembled.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Professor was preparing to go to bed in his
icy room at the Sole when two police-agents came
with a summons for him to appear at once at the
police-station.</p>

<p>He felt some secret misgivings, but did not lose
his head, and went quietly away with the two
men. At the station a little impudent Commissary
asked him why he had come to Lodi, and
upon being informed that he had come on private
business shrugged his shoulders in contemptuous
incredulity. What private business did Signor
Gilardoni pretend to have in Lodi? With whom?
The Professor mentioned the Marchesa. "There
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
are no Maironis at Lodi," the Commissary exclaimed,
and when his victim protested he
speedily interrupted him. "<i>Basta!</i> That will
do! That will do!" The police knew for a certainty
that Professor Gilardoni, although he was
an Imperial and Royal pensioner, was not a loyal
Austrian; that he had friends at Lugano, and
that he had come to Lodi for political ends.</p>

<p>"You are better informed than I am," Gilardoni
exclaimed, restraining his wrath with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Silence!" the Commissary commanded.
"You must not think the Imperial and Royal
government is afraid of you. You are free to go,
but you must leave Lodi within two hours."</p>

<p>At this point Franco would have immediately
perceived from whence the blow came, but the
philosopher did not understand.</p>

<p>"I came to Lodi on most urgent business,
which is not yet finished," said he. "On most
important, private business. How can I leave
in two hours?"</p>

<p>"By carriage. If you are still in Lodi at the
end of two hours I shall have you arrested."</p>

<p>"My health does not permit me to travel at
night in December," the victim urged.</p>

<p>"Very well, then I will have you arrested at
once!"</p>

<p>The poor philosopher took up his hat in silence,
and went out.</p>

<p>An hour later he started for Milan in a closed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
calash, his feet embedded in straw, a rug over his
legs, a great muffler round his neck, reflecting that
this had been a most successful expedition, and
swallowing momently to see if his throat were sore.
He passed a horrible night, indeed, but the
Marchesa herself did not rest on a bed of roses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
HOURS OF BITTERNESS</h2>

<p>On the last day of the year, while Franco was
writing out the very minute directions
concerning the care of the flowers and the kitchen-garden,
which he intended to leave for his wife's
guidance, and the uncle sat reading for the tenth
time his favourite book, the <i>History of the Diocese
of Como</i>, Luisa went out for a walk with Maria.
The sun was shining brightly. There was no
snow save on Bisgnago and Galbiga. Maria
found a violet near the cemetery, and another
down in the Calcinera. There it was really warm,
and the air was pleasantly scented with laurel.
Luisa sat down to think, with her back to the hill,
and allowed Maria to amuse herself by climbing
up the bank behind her, and sliding down again
on the dry grass.</p>

<p>She had not seen the Professor since Christmas
Eve, and she longed to speak with him; not to
hear the story of the Maironi will over again, but
to get him to tell her about his interview with
Franco, when he had shown it to him: to ascertain
what Franco's first impression had been and
what the Professor's opinion was. As the will
had been destroyed, all this could only be of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
psychological importance, but Luisa's curiosity
was not the curiosity of the idle observer. Her
husband's conduct had deeply wounded her.
Thinking of it over and over again, as she had
done ever since Christmas Eve, she had arrived at
the conclusion that his silence towards her had
been an outrage against justice and affection. It
was a bitter sorrow to her to feel her esteem for
him diminishing, especially bitter now, on the eve
of his departure, and at a time when he really
deserved praise. She would have liked, at least,
to know that when Gilardoni had shown him the
documents there had been some inward struggle,
that a more just sentiment had been aroused in
his soul, if only for a moment. She rose, took
Maria by the hand, and started towards Casarico.</p>

<p>She found the Professor in the garden with
Pinella, and told Maria to run and play with the
boy, but Maria, always eager to listen to the conversation
of her elders, would not hear of going.
Then Luisa broached the subject without mentioning
any names. She wished to speak to the Professor
about certain papers, about those old
letters. The Professor, who was crimson, protested
that he did not understand. Fortunately,
Pinella called Maria, enticing her with a picture-book,
and she ran to him, conquered by her curiosity
concerning the book. Then Luisa relieved the
Professor of his scruples, by informing him that
Franco himself had told her everything, and she
confessed to him that she had disapproved of her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
husband's conduct, that it had been, and still was
a source of great sorrow to her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, why, why?" said the worthy Professor,
interrupting her. Because Franco had
not been willing to do anything. "I have done
something! I have done something!" Gilardoni
exclaimed, anxiously and excitedly. "But
for the love of Heaven, don't tell your husband!"
Luisa was amazed. What had the Professor
done? And when, and how? And was not the
will already destroyed?</p>

<p>Then Gilardoni, as red as a glowing coal, his
eyes full of anxiety, his recital often interrupted
by such exclamations as, "For mercy's sake,
don't tell!&mdash;You will be silent, eh?" revealed all
his secrets to her, from the preserving of the will
to his journey to Lodi. Luisa listened to the very
end, and then, clasping her face tightly between
her hands, uttered a horrified "Ah!"</p>

<p>"Did I do wrong?" said the poor Professor,
much alarmed. "Did I do wrong, Signora
Luisina?"</p>

<p>"Very wrong! Terribly wrong! Forgive me,
but it looked as if you were proposing some transaction,
some bargain, and the Marchesa is sure
to believe we are in league with you! Oh, it is
awful!"</p>

<p>She wrung her clenched hands as if striving to
press into shape, to remodel a more level professorial
head for him. In utter amazement the
poor Professor kept repeating: "Oh, Lord! Oh,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
dear me! Oh, what an ass I am!" without really
comprehending the nature of his blunder. Luisa
flung herself upon the parapet overhanging the
lake, and stared into the water. Suddenly she
started up, beating the back of her right hand
upon the palm of her left, her face brightening.
"Take me to your study," said she. "Can I
leave Maria here?" The Professor nodded, and,
trembling, accompanied her to the study. Luisa
took a sheet of paper and wrote rapidly: "Luisa
Maironi Rigey begs to inform the Marchesa
Maironi Scremin that Professor Beniamino Gilardoni
is a most faithful friend of both her husband
and herself, but that they nevertheless heartily
disapprove of his inopportune use of a document
which should have been disposed of in a different
manner. Therefore, no communication from the
Marchesa is either expected or desired."</p>

<p>When she had finished she silently held out the
letter to the Professor. "Oh no!" he exclaimed,
as soon as he had read it; "For the love of Heaven
don't send that letter! What if your husband
should find it out? Think what a misfortune for
me, for you yourself! And how can it possibly
be kept from your husband?" Luisa did not
answer, but gazed fixedly at him, not thinking of
him, but of Franco; thinking that the Marchesa
might look upon the letter as a snare, an attempt
to intimidate her, she took it back and tore it in
pieces, with a sigh. The Professor became radiant,
and wished to kiss her hand, but she protested.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
She had not done it for his sake or for
Franco's but for other reasons. The sacrifice of
this outlet for her feelings exasperated her still
more against Franco. "He is wrong! He is
wrong!" she repeated, with bitterness in her heart,
and neither she nor the Professor noticed that
Maria was in the room. On seeing her mother
leave the garden the little one no longer wished
to remain with Pinella, so he had brought her to
the door of the study, opening it noiselessly for
her. The child, struck by her mother's expression,
stopped and stared at her with a look of
terror. She saw her tear the letter and heard
her exclaim: "He is wrong!" and then she began
to cry. Luisa hastened to her, folded her
in her arms, and consoled her, and then they
immediately took their departure. The Professor's
parting words were: "For pity's sake,
be silent!"</p>

<p>"Why be silent?" Maria quickly demanded.
Her mother did not heed her; her thoughts were
elsewhere. Three or four times Maria repeated:
"Why be silent?" until at last Luisa said:
"Hush! That will do." Then she was quiet for
a time, but presently she began again, simply to
tease her mother, and lifting her little, laughing
face repeated: "Why be silent?" This time
she was well scolded, and once more became
silent; but when they were passing below the
cemetery, only a few steps from home, she again
burst forth, with the same mischievous laugh.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Then Luisa, who had been absorbed in the effort
to compose her face into an expression of indifference,
simply gave her a shake, but it sufficed to
silence her.</p>

<p>That day Maria was in very high spirits. At
dinner, while jesting with her mother, she suddenly
recalled the reprimands she had received
when out walking, and looking covertly at Luisa,
once more repeated her "Why be silent?" with
the same timid and provoking little laugh. Her
mother pretended not to hear, so she persevered.
Then Luisa checked her with an "Enough!" so
unusually stern that Maria's little mouth opened
wider and wider, and the tears began to flow.
Uncle Piero exclaimed: "Oh dear me!" and
Franco frowned, showing that he disapproved of
his wife's action. As Maria kept on crying, he
vented his displeasure upon her, took her in his
arms, and carried her off, screaming like an eagle.
"Better still!" said Uncle Piero. "Fine disciplinarians,
both of you!" "You let them
alone," said Cia, for Luisa did not speak. "Parents
must be obeyed." "That's it! Let us
have your wisdom also!" Uncle Piero retorted,
and Cia relapsed into sullen silence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Franco returned, having deposited
Maria in one corner of the alcove-room, grumbling
something about people who seemed bound to
make children cry. And now Luisa also was
vexed, and went to fetch Maria, whom she presently
brought back in a lachrymose but mute
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
state. The short meal ended badly, for Maria
would not eat, and all the others were out of temper
for one reason or another; all save Uncle
Piero, who set about lecturing Maria, half seriously
half playfully, until he succeeded in bringing a
little sunshine back to her face. After dinner
Franco went to look after some flower-pots,
which he kept in the cellar below the little hanging
garden, and took Maria with him. Seeing her
once more in good spirits, he gently questioned
her about what had happened. What did
she mean by that "Why be silent?" "I don't
know." "But why did mamma not wish you
to say it?" "I don't know. I kept saying that,
and mamma kept scolding me." "When?" "Out
walking." "Where did you go?" "To the
Signor Ladroni's." (It was Uncle Piero who had
thus simplified the Professor's name.) "And did
you begin saying that when you were at Signor
Ladroni's house?" "No. Signor Ladroni said
it to mamma." "What did he say?" "Why,
papa, you don't understand anything! He said:
'For pity's sake be silent!'" Franco said no more.
"Mamma tore a paper at Signor Ladroni's house,"
Maria added, believing her father would be all
the better pleased the more she told him concerning
that visit, but he ordered her to be quiet.
On returning to the house Franco asked Luisa,
with an expression that was far from amiable,
why she had made the child cry. Luisa scrutinised
him closely. It seemed to her he suspected
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
something, and she asked indignantly if
he expected her to seek to justify herself for such
petty matters. "Oh no!" Franco answered
coldly, and went into the garden to see if the dry
leaves at the base of the orange-trees and the
straw around the trunks were in order, for the
night promised to be very cold. As he worked
over the plants he reflected that had they possessed
intelligence and words they would have
shown themselves more affectionate, more grateful
than usual, on account of his imminent departure,
while Luisa had the heart to be harsh
with him. He did not remember that he also had
been harsh. Luisa, on the other hand, at once
regretted her answer, but she could not hold him
back, throw her arms about his neck, and end it
all with a kiss or two; that other matter weighed
too heavily on her heart. Franco finished swathing
his orange trees and came into the house for
his cape, intending to go to church at Albogasio.
Luisa, who was in the kitchen peeling some
chestnuts, heard him pass through the corridor,
stood hesitating a moment, struggling with herself,
and then rushed out, catching up with him
just as he was starting downstairs.</p>

<p>"Franco!" said she. Franco did not answer,
but seemed to repulse her. Then she seized his
arm and dragged him into the neighbouring
alcove room.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said he, shaken, but
still determined to appear vexed. Luisa, instead
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
of answering, threw her arms about his
neck, drew his unwilling head upon her breast,
and said softly&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must not quarrel these last days."</p>

<p>He had expected words of excuse, and pushed
his wife's arm aside, answering dryly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have not quarrelled. Perhaps you will tell
me," he added, "what Professor Gilardoni confided
to you that was such a great secret that he
felt obliged to entreat you to be silent."</p>

<p>Luisa looked at him, amazed and pained. "You
doubted me?" said she. "You questioned the
child? Did you indeed do that?"</p>

<p>"Well," he cried, "and what if I did? Anyway,
I am well aware you always think the worst
of me. Listen now. I don't want to know anything."
She interrupted him. "But I will tell
you! I will tell you!" His conscience was
pricking him a little on account of his questioning
of the child, and now seeing Luisa ready to speak,
he would not listen to her, and forbade her to explain.
But his heart was full to overflowing with
bitterness, for which he must find an outlet. He
complained that since Christmas Eve she had not
been the same to him. Why protest? He had
seen it clearly. Indeed, something else had long
been clear to him. What? Oh, something very
natural! Perfectly natural! Was he, after all,
worthy of her love? Certainly not. He was only
a poor useless creature, and nothing more. Was
it not natural that upon knowing him better she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
should love him less? For surely she did love
him less than at one time!</p>

<p>Luisa trembled, fearful that this might be true.</p>

<p>"No, Franco, no!" she cried, but her very
dread of not saying the words with proper conviction
was sufficient to paralyze her voice. He
had expected a violent denial, and murmured
terrified: "My God!" Then it was her turn to
be terrified, and she pressed him despairingly in
her arms, sobbing: "No, no, no!" By means
of some magnetic current they understood each
other's every thought, and remained long united
in a close embrace, speaking in a mute, spasmodic
effort of their whole being, complaining
one of the other, reproaching, passionately striving
to draw together again, revelling in the sharp
and bitter delight of being, for the moment,
united by sheer force of will and of love, in spite
of the secret disunion of their ideas, of their
natures; and all this without a word, without a
sound.</p>

<p>Franco once more started to go to church. He
would not invite Luisa to accompany him, hoping
she would do so of her own free will, but she did
not, fearing he might not wish it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the morning of the seventh of January,
shortly after ten o'clock, Uncle Piero sent for
Franco.</p>

<p>The uncle was still in bed. He was in the
habit of rising late, because his room could not be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
heated, and for the sake of economy he did not
wish the fire in the little salon lighted too early.
However, the cold did not prevent his sitting up
in bed and reading, half his chest and both arms
outside the covers.</p>

<p>"<i>Ciao!</i> Good-morning!" said he, as Franco
entered.</p>

<p>From the tone of his greeting, from the expression
of the fine face, serious in its kindliness,
Franco understood that Uncle Piero was about
to say something unusual.</p>

<p>In fact, the uncle pointed to the chair beside
his bed, and uttered the most solemn of his exordiums&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit you down!"</p>

<p>Franco sat down.</p>

<p>"So you are leaving to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>It would seem that in uttering that "Good!"
the uncle's heart came into his mouth, for the
word filled his cheeks, and came out full and
ringing.</p>

<p>"So far," the old man continued, "you have
never heard me&mdash;let us say&mdash;either approve or
disapprove of your plan. Perhaps I did not feel
quite sure you would carry it out. But now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Franco stretched out both hands to him.
"Now," Uncle Piero went on, pressing those hands
in his own, "seeing you are firm in your resolve,
I say to you: Your resolve is good. We are in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
need, go; work, work is a great thing! May
God help you to begin well, and then help you to
persevere, which is a far more difficult thing.
There!"</p>

<p>Franco would have kissed his hands, but he was
quick to withdraw them. "Let them alone! Let
them alone!" And he once more began to speak.</p>

<p>"Now listen. It is quite possible we may
never meet again." Franco protested. "Yes,
yes, yes!" the old man exclaimed, withdrawing
his soul from his eyes and voice. "Those are all
fine things, things that must be said. But let
them go!"</p>

<p>The eyes once more resumed their kindly and
serious light, and the voice its grave tone.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible we shall never meet again.
After all, I put it to you, what good am I now in
this world? It would be far better for you if I
took my departure. Perhaps your grandmother
resents my having taken you in; perhaps, if I
were gone, it would be easier for her to accept a
reconciliation. Therefore, supposing we never
meet again, I beg you to make some overtures
to her as soon as I am dead, if things have not
already been arranged."</p>

<p>Franco rose and embraced his uncle with tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have made no will," Uncle Piero continued,
"and I shall not make one. What little I have
belongs to Luisa; no will is necessary. I commend
Cia to your care. Do not let her want for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
a bed and a crust of bread. As to my funeral,
three priests will suffice to sing my <i>requiem</i> with
true feeling; our own priest, Intrioni, and the
Prefect of Caravina. There is no necessity of
having five, who will sing it for love of the candles
and the white wine. Leave the question of my
clothes to Luisa, she will know what to do with
them. You yourself will keep my repeater to
remind you of me. I should like to leave Maria
a keepsake, but what shall it be? I might give
her a piece of my gold chain. If you have a
little medallion or a crucifix you may attach it to
my chain and hang it round her neck. And now,
Amen!"</p>

<p>Franco was in tears. It was a great shock to
hear the uncle speak of his death thus calmly, as
if it had been some matter of business which must
be arranged judiciously and honestly; the uncle
who, when conversing with his friends, seemed
so deeply attached to life that he would often
say: "If one could only avoid that inevitable
breakdown!!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Now tell me," said Uncle Piero, "what
sort of work do you expect to find?"</p>

<p>"T. writes that at first I am to go into a newspaper
office in Turin. Perhaps I shall find something
better later on. If I don't earn enough to
live on in the office, and nothing else turns up, I
shall come back. Therefore all this must be
kept perfectly secret&mdash;at least, for a time."</p>

<p>Uncle Piero was incredulous concerning the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
possibility of secrecy. "And how about the
letters?" he inquired.</p>

<p>As to letters, it had been arranged that Franco
should address his to the postoffice at Lugano, and
Ismaele would take those from the family to
Lugano, and bring back his. And what should
they tell their friends? They had already said that
Franco was going to Milan, on the eighth, on
business, and would be absent perhaps a month,
perhaps longer.</p>

<p>"It is not the most agreeable thing in the world
to have to throw dust in people's eyes," the
uncle said. "But however...! I am going
to embrace you now, Franco, for I know you are
leaving early to-morrow morning, and we shall
hardly be alone together to-day. Good-bye,
then. Once more, remember all my injunctions,
and don't forget me. Oh, one thing more! You
are going to Turin. As a government official I
always did what I could to be of service to my
country. I never conspired, and I would not
conspire even now, but I have always loved my
country. And so, salute the tricolour for me.
Good-bye, my dear boy!"</p>

<p>Then Uncle Piero opened his arms.</p>

<p>"You shall come to Piedmont also, uncle,"
Franco said, as he rose from that embrace, greatly
moved. "If I can only manage to earn money
enough I shall send for you all."</p>

<p>"Ah no, my dear boy! I am too old, I shall
not make another move."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
    "Very well, then. I myself will come next
spring, with two hundred thousand of my friends."</p>

<p>"That's it! Two hundred thousand pumpkins!
A fine idea! Fine hopes!&mdash;Oh! here is Signorina
Missipipì."</p>

<p>Signorina Missipipì&mdash;thus the family called
Maria in happy moments&mdash;came in, dignified and
serious. "Good-morning, uncle. Will you say
'Missipipì' for me?"</p>

<p>Her father lifted her up and placed her on Uncle
Piero's bed. Smiling the old man drew her
towards him, and set her across his legs.</p>

<p>"Come here, miss. Did you sleep well? And
did the doll sleep well, and the mule also? The
mule was not there? So much the better. Yes,
yes! I am coming to 'Missipipì.' Am I not to
have a kiss first? Only one? Then I shall have
to say:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proud shade of the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Missipipì,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't play you are bashful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of kisses give three."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Maria listened as if hearing the lines for the
first time, then she burst out laughing, and began
to jump and clap her hands, while her uncle laughed
with her.</p>

<p>"Papa," said she, suddenly becoming serious.
"Why are you crying? Have you been naughty?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>They expected many friends would call that
day, many who had promised to come and say
good-bye to Franco before his departure for Milan.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Luisa performed the miracle of lighting the stove
in Siberia, as Uncle Piero called the hall, and at
one time Donna Ester, the two Pauls from Loggio,
Paolin and Paolon, and Professor Gilardoni were
all there together. Then presently Signora Peppina
arrived, most unexpectedly, for she had
never been to see them since the search. "Oh,
my dear <i>Süra</i> Luisa! Oh, my dear Don Franco!
Is it true you are really going away?" Paolin
began to shift uneasily on his chair, for he feared
Signora Peppina had been sent by her husband to
see who had and who had not rallied round the
suspected man, in this house that was under the
ban. He longed to go away at once with his
Paolon, but Paolon was more dense. "How shall
I manage now, with this idiot, who doesn't understand
anything?" thought Paolin, and without
looking at Paolon he said to him, in an undertone:
"Let us go, <i>Paol</i>, let us go!" It did indeed take
Paolon some time to get it through his head, but
finally he arose and went out with Paolin, getting
his lesson on the stairs.</p>

<p>Franco had the same thought as Paolin, and
greeted Signora Peppina coldly. The poor woman
could have wept, for she dearly loved his wife, and
held Franco himself in great esteem, but she understood
his aversion, and in her heart excused it.
Franco was relieved when Veronica came to call
him.</p>

<p>He was wanted in the kitchen garden. He
went there and found Signor Giacomo Puttini and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Don Giuseppe Costabarbieri, who had come to
say good-bye, but having been informed by
Paolin and Paolon of the presence of Signora
Peppina, they did not wish her to see them.
Even the soil of the kitchen-garden scorched
their feet. While the little lean hero was puffing
and parrying Franco's invitation to go up to the
house, the little fat hero was rolling his head and
his small eyes like a good-natured blackbird,
looking from the hills to the lake, almost from a
habit of suspicion. He caught sight of a boat
coming from Porlezza. Who knows? Might it
not be bringing the Imperial and Royal Commissary?
Although the boat was still at some
distance, he immediately began to cast about for
an excuse for going away, and determined to take
Puttini to call upon the Receiver, as they would
be sure of not finding Signora Peppina at home.</p>

<p>Having lavished many hasty and muttered
compliments on Franco, the two old hares trotted
off, with bowed heads, leaving Franco in the
kitchen-garden. Meanwhile the boat Don Giuseppe
had seen had come rapidly forward, and
was now passing in front of the garden, at some
distance from the shore. It contained a lady and
a gentleman. The gentleman rose and saluted
Franco in a loud voice: "How are you, Don
Franco? Long life to you!" The lady waved
her handkerchief. The Pasottis! Franco saluted
with his hat.</p>

<p>The Pasottis in Valsolda in January! Why
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
had they come? And that greeting! Pasotti
salute him thus? Pasotti, who had never been
near them since the search? What did all this
mean? Franco, greatly perplexed, went up to the
house and told the news. All were amazed, and
most of all Signora Peppina. "How? Do you
really mean it? The Signor Controller of all
men! And Signora Barborin also, poor little
woman!" The event was excitedly discussed.
Some thought one thing, some another. In
about five minutes Pasotti came noisily in, dragging
Signora Barborin behind him. She was
laden with shawls and bundles and half dead with
the cold. The poor creature could only keep
repeating: "Two hours in the boat! Two hours
in the boat!"</p>

<p>"Whatever brought you to Valsolda in this
weather, <i>Süra</i> Pasotti?" Peppina screamed at
her. "Oh, gracious! She don't understand anything,
poor little woman!" And though Luisa
and Ester shouted the same question in her ear,
and though she opened her mouth wide, the poor
deaf woman could not understand, and continued
to answer at random: "Have I had my
dinner? If I will dine here?" At last Pasotti
came to the rescue, and told them that he and his
wife had been called away by urgent business in
October, and the last washing had been left undone.
His wife had been worrying him for some
time about that blessed washing, and finally he
had made up his mind to satisfy her by coming.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Then Donna Ester turned to Signora Pasotti,
going through the pantomime of washing.</p>

<p>Barborin glanced at her husband, who had his
eyes fixed upon her, and answered: "Yes, yes.
The washing! The washing!" That glance, the
order she read in the Controller's eyes, made Luisa
suspect a mystery underlying all this. This
mystery and the inexplicable effusiveness of
Pasotti suggested another suspicion to her. What
if they had come on her account and Franco's?
What if the Professor's trip to Lodi had something
to do with bringing about this unexpected
visit? She would have liked to consult the Professor
and beg him to remain until the Pasottis
had left, but then, how could she speak to him
without Franco's noticing it? Meanwhile Donna
Ester was saying good-bye, and Gilardoni was
graciously permitted to escort her home.</p>

<p>The Pasottis could not go up to Albogasio
Superiore until the farmer, who had been notified
at once, should have had time to prepare and heat
at least one room for their reception. The Controller
at once proposed a three-handed game of
<i>tarocchi</i> with the Engineer and Franco. Then
Signora Peppina went away, and Barborin asked
Luisa to allow her to withdraw for a few minutes,
and begged her hostess to accompany her. As
soon as he was alone with her friend in the alcove
room, she glanced all about her with wide, frightened
eyes, and then whispered: "We are not
here on account of the washing, you know. Not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
on account of the washing!" Luisa questioned
her silently with face and gestures, for had she
spoken in a loud voice they would have heard her
in the hall. This time Signora Pasotti understood,
and replied that she did not know anything, that
her husband had not told her anything, that he
had ordered her to corroborate the story about
the washing, but that really she was not in the
least anxious about it. Then Luisa took a piece
of paper and wrote: "What do you suspect?"
Signora Pasotti read the words, and then began
a most complicated pantomime: shakings of
the head, rollings of the eyes, sighs, imploring
glances towards the ceiling. It was as if a mighty
struggle were going on within her between hope
and fear. At last she uttered an "Ah?" seized
the pen, and wrote below Luisa's question:</p>

<p>"The Marchesa!"</p>

<p>Then she dropped the pen and stood looking
at her friend. "She is at Lodi," she said in an
undertone. "The Controller has been to Lodi.
So there you have it!" And she hastened back
to the hall, faring to arouse her husband's suspicions.</p>

<p>The game over, Pasotti went to one of the
windows, saying something in a loud voice about
the effect of the twilight, and called Franco to
him. "You must come and see me this evening,"
he said softly. "I have something to say to you."
Franco sought to excuse himself. He was starting
the next morning for Milan, leaving his family
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
for some time; he could hardly spend this last
evening away from home. Pasotti answered
that it was absolutely necessary. "It concerns
your journey to-morrow!" said he.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"It concerns your journey to-morrow!" As
soon as the Pasottis had left for Albogasio Superiore,
Franco repeated the conversation to his
wife. He had been much upset by it. So Pasotti
knew! He would not have been so mysterious
had he not been alluding to the journey to Turin,
and Franco was greatly vexed to think that
Pasotti was aware of this. But how had he found
out? Perhaps the friend in Turin had been indiscreet.
And now what did Pasotti want of
him? Was another blow perhaps about to be
struck by the police? But Pasotti was not the
man to come and warn him. And all that hypocritical
amiability? Perhaps they did not wish
him to go to Turin, did not wish him to find an
easier path, to free himself and his family from
poverty, from commissaries and gendarmes. He
thought and thought, and finally decided this must
be the reason. In her heart Luisa greatly doubted
it. She feared something else; but she also was
persuaded Pasotti knew about Turin, and this
upset all her suppositions. After all, the only
way was to go and find out.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Franco went at eight o'clock and Pasotti received
him with the most effusive cordiality, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
apologised for his wife's absence, she having already
gone to bed. Before opening the conversation
he insisted that Franco should take a glass
of S. Colombano, and a piece of <i>panettone</i>. With
the wine and the cake Franco was obliged to
swallow, much against his will, many declarations
of friendship, and the most exalted eulogies
upon his wife, his uncle, and himself. The glass
and the plate being at last empty, the mellifluous
rogue showed himself disposed to come to business.</p>

<p>They were seated facing each other at a small
table. Pasotti, leaning back comfortably in his
chair, held a red and yellow silk handkerchief in
his hands, with which he played constantly.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "as I told you, my dear
Franco, the matter concerns your journey to-morrow.
I heard it said to-day at your house
that you are going away on business. Now it
remains to be seen whether I am not bringing you
still more important business than that which calls
you to Milan."</p>

<p>Franco remained silent, surprised by this unexpected
preamble. Pasotti continued, his eyes
fixed on the handkerchief which he never ceased
handling.</p>

<p>"Of course, my good friend Don Franco Maironi
knows that if I touch upon intimate and delicate
questions it is because I have a serious reason for
doing so; because I feel it my duty, and because
I am authorised to do so."</p>

<p>The hands became still, the shining and cunning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
eyes were raised to Franco's distrustful and
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"It concerns both your present and your future,
my dear Franco."</p>

<p>Having uttered these words, Pasotti resolutely
laid aside the handkerchief. Resting his arms
and his clasped hands on the little table, he went
to the heart of the matter, keeping his eyes fixed
upon Franco, who now, in his turn, leaning back
in his chair, returned the gaze, his face pale, his
attitude one of hostile defiance.</p>

<p>"You must know that the old friendship I bear
your family has long been urging me to do something
to put an end to a most painful quarrel.
Your good father, Don Alessandro!&mdash;What a
heart of gold!&mdash;How fond he was of me!" (Franco
was aware that his father had once threatened
Pasotti with his cane, for meddling overmuch in
his family affairs.) "Never mind! Having learned
that your grandmother was at Lodi, I said to
myself last Sunday: After all the trouble the Maironis
have had, perhaps this is the right moment.
Let us go and make the attempt. And I went."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Franco was quivering.
What a mediator he had had! And who had
asked for mediation?</p>

<p>"I must tell you," Pasotti went on, "that I
feel satisfied. Your grandmother has her own
opinions, and she has reached an age when opinions
are not easily changed; you know her character;
she is very firm, but after all, she is not heartless.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
She loves you, you know, and she suffers. There
is a continuous struggle going on within her,
between her sentiments and her principles; or,
one might rather say, between her sentiments
and her resentment. Poor Marchesa, it is painful
to see how she suffers! But anyhow she is
beginning to yield. Of course we must not expect
too much. She is indeed yielding, but not
sufficiently to break what sustains her&mdash;her principles
I mean, especially her political principles."</p>

<p>Franco's eyes, his twitching jaws, a quivering
of his whole person said to Pasotti: "Woe to
you if you touch upon that point!" Pasotti
stopped. Perhaps he was thinking of the cane of
the late Don Alessandro.</p>

<p>"I understand your feelings," he continued.
"Do you think I don't? I eat the government's
bread, and must keep what I feel shut up in my
heart, but, nevertheless, I am with you. I sigh
for the moment when certain colours shall replace
certain others. But your grandmother
holds different opinions, and there is nothing for
it but to take her as she is. If we want to arrive
at an understanding we must take her as she is.
You may seek to oppose her as I myself did,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All this talk appears to me perfectly useless,"
Franco exclaimed, rising.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Pasotti added. "The affair may
not prove as disagreeable as you think! Sit down
and listen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
    But Franco would not hear of resuming his seat.</p>

<p>"Out with it, then!" said he, his voice ringing
impatiently.</p>

<p>"First of all your grandmother is prepared to
recognise your marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How kind!" Franco put in.</p>

<p>"Wait!&mdash;--and to make you a suitable allowance:
from what I heard I should think of
from six to eight thousand <i>svanziche</i> a year. Not
bad, eh?"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Be patient! There is nothing humiliating in
all this. Had there been a single humiliating
condition I should not have mentioned the matter
to you. Your grandmother wishes you to have
an occupation, and also desires that you give a
certain guarantee not to take part in political
doings. Now there is a decorous way of combining
these two points, as you yourself will be
obliged to recognise, although I tell you plainly
that I had proposed a different course to your
grandmother. My idea was that she should place
you at the head of her affairs. You would have
had enough to do to keep you from thinking of
anything else. However, your grandmother's
idea is good also. I know fine young fellows
like yourself, who think as you do, and who
are in the judicial service. It is a most independent
and respectable calling. A word from
you and you will find yourself an auditor of the
court."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
    "I?" Franco burst out. "I? No, my dear
Pasotti! No! They don't send the police into
my house&mdash;be quiet!&mdash;they don't brutally dismiss
from service an honest man, whose only crime is
that he is my wife's uncle,&mdash;be quiet, I tell you!&mdash;they
don't seek every possible means of reducing
my family and myself to the verge of starvation
to-day, that they may offer us filthy bread to-morrow!
No, my man, no! Do your worst!
By God! I am not to be trapped by any one
through hunger! Tell my grandmother so, you&mdash;&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pasotti's nature certainly had much that was
feline; he was rapacious, cunning, prudent, a
flatterer, quick to feign, but also subject to fits of
rage. He had continued to interrupt Maironi's
outpouring with protests which became ever more
violent, and at this last invective, forseeing the
approach of a deluge of accusations which were
all the more exasperating because he could guess
their character, he also started to his feet.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said he. "What do you mean by all
this?"</p>

<p>"Good-night!" cried Franco, who had seized
his hat. But Pasotti had no intention of letting
him go thus. "One moment!" said he, bringing
his fist down swiftly and repeatedly on the little
table. "You people are deluding yourselves!
You hope great things from that will; but it is
not a will at all, it is simply a bit of waste paper,
the ravings of a madman!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
    Franco, who had already reached the door,
stopped short, stunned by the blow. "What
will?" said he.</p>

<p>"Come now!" Pasotti retorted, half coldly,
half mockingly. "We understand each other
perfectly!"</p>

<p>A flash of rage once more set Franco's blood on
fire. "We do not!" he cried. "Out with it!
Speak! What do you know of any will?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Now we are getting on famously!"
Pasotti said with ironical sweetness.</p>

<p>Franco could have strangled him.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I have been to Lodi? So of
course I know!"</p>

<p>Franco, quite beside himself, protested that he
was entirely in the dark.</p>

<p>"Of course," Pasotti continued, with greater
irony than before. "It is for me to enlighten
the gentleman! Then I will inform you that Professor
Gilardoni, who is by no means the friend
you believe him to be, went to Lodi at the end of
December, and presented himself before the
Marchesa with a legally worthless copy of a will
which he pretends was made by your late grandfather.
This will appoints you, Don Franco,
residuary legatee, in terms attrociously insulting
to both the wife and the son of the testator.
So now you know. Indeed, Signor Gilardoni did
not betray his trust, but stated that he had come
on his own responsibility, and without your
knowledge."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
    Franco listened, as pale as death, feeling darkness
creeping over his sight and his soul, mustering
all his strength that he might not lose his head,
but be able to give a fitting answer.</p>

<p>"You are right," said he. "Grandmother is
right also. It is Professor Gilardoni who has
done wrong. He showed me that will three years
ago, on the night of my marriage. I told him to
burn it, and believed he had done so. If he did
not, he deceived me. If he really went to Lodi
on the charming errand you describe, he has committed
an act of outrageous indelicacy and stupidity.
You were quite justified in thinking ill of us.
But mark this! I despise my grandmother's
money as heartily as I despise the money of the
government, and as this lady has the good fortune
to be the mother of my father, I will never&mdash;never,
I say&mdash;although she resort to the most
base, the most perfidious means of ruining me&mdash;never
make use of a document that dishonours
her. I am too much her superior! Go and
tell her this in my name, and tell her also to
withdraw her offers, for I spurn them! Good-night!!"</p>

<p>He left Pasotti in a state of utter amazement,
and went his way, trembling with over-excitement
and rage. He forgot his lantern, and went
down the hill in the dark, striding along, neither
knowing nor caring where he placed his feet, and
from time to time uttering an ejaculation, pouring
out that which was seething within him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>&mdash;rage
against Gilardoni, and accusations against
Luisa!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Uncle Piero had gone to bed early, and Luisa
was waiting for Franco in the little salon with
Maria, whom she had kept up that her father
might see something of her this last night. Poor
little Signorina Missipipì had very soon grown
weary, and had begun to open wide her little
mouth, and assume a tearful expression, asking
in a small and pitiful voice: "When is papa
coming?" But she possessed a mamma who was
unrivalled in consoling the afflicted. Now it was
some time since Signorina Missipipì had owned a
pair of whole little shoes: and little shoes, even in
Valsolda, cost money. Not much money, it is
true, but what is to be done when you have hardly
any? However, this unique mamma was also
unrivalled in shoeing those who were shoeless.
The very day before, Luisa, in searching for a
piece of rope in the attic, had found a boot which
had belonged to her grandfather, buried beneath a
heap of rubbish, of empty boxes and broken chairs.
She had put it in water to soften, and had borrowed
a shoemaker's knife, an awl, and shears. She
now took the venerable boot, that frightened
Maria, and placed it on the table. "Now we will
recite its funeral oration," said she, with that liveliness
she could assume at will, and of which even
mortal anguish could not rob her, if she deemed it
necessary to be lively. "But first you must ask
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
your great-grandfather's permission to take his
boot." She made Maria clasp her hands, and
recite the following jingle, her eyes comically
raised to the ceiling.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great granddad of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who to heav'n did climb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This boot, to you useless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray give to this princess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who longs in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For slippers twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throws you a kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pert little Miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which she begs you to put<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the sole of your foot.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then followed a somewhat irreverent fancy, one
of many such born in Luisa's brain&mdash;a strange
story of the little angel who polishes the boots in
heaven, and who one day let great-grandfather's
boot fall to the earth while attempting to grab a
bit of golden bread he had been forbidden to touch.
Maria brightened visibly; she laughed and interrupted
her mother with a hundred questions concerning
the other boot that was still in heaven.
What would her great-grandfather do with that?
Her mother replied that he would apply it from
behind to the Emperor of Austria, and push him
out of heaven with it, if he chanced to meet him
there.</p>

<p>Just at that moment Franco entered.</p>

<p>Luisa at once saw signs of storm on his brow
and in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well?" she questioned. Franco answered
shortly: "Put Maria to bed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
    Luisa observed that she had kept the child up
waiting for him, that she might spend a little time
with him. "I tell you to put her to bed!" Franco
said, so harshly that Maria began to cry. Luisa
flushed, but was silent. Lighting a candle she
took the child in her arms and silently held her up
that her father might give her a kiss. He did so
coldly, and then Luisa carried her away. Franco
did not follow her. The sight of the boot irritated
him, and he threw it upon the floor. Then he sat
down, planted his elbows on the table, and rested
his head in his hands.</p>

<p>The bitter thought that Luisa was Gilardoni's
accomplice had immediately flashed into his mind
while Pasotti was talking, and with it there came
also the recollection of that "Why be silent?" of
that "Enough!" and of the child's story. He
felt as if he had a whirlwind within him, in which
this idea was being continually caught up and
whirled away, to reappear again farther down,
ever nearer the heart.</p>

<p>"Well?" Luisa once more asked, as she entered
the room. Franco looked at her a moment in
silence, scrutinising her closely. Then he rose and
seized her hands. "Tell me if you know anything?"
said he. She guessed his meaning, but that look
and manner offended her. "What do you mean?"
she exclaimed, her face aflame. "Why do you ask
in that way?" "Ah! you do know!" cried Franco
flinging away her hands, and raising his arms with
a despairing gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
    She foresaw what was coming&mdash;his suspicion of
her complicity with Gilardoni, her denial, and the
mortal irremediable offence Franco would be
offering her if, in his wrath, he refused to trust her
word, and she clasped her hands in terror. "No,
Franco! No, Franco!" she murmured softly, and
threw her arms about his neck, striving to close his
lips with kisses. But he misunderstood her, believed
she was seeking forgiveness, and pushed her
aside. "I know! Yes, I know!" she cried, once
more casting herself passionately upon his breast.
"But I found out afterwards, when it was already
done, and I was as indignant as you are, even more
indignant!" But Franco was too anxious to give
vent to his feelings, too anxious to offend. "How
can I know you are speaking the truth?" he exclaimed.
She started back with a cry, and then
once more coming a step nearer, she held out her
arms to him. "No, no!" she entreated in agony,
"Tell me you believe me! Tell me so now, for if
you do not say so, you don't know, you can't
realise what will happen!"</p>

<p>"What is it I can't realise?"</p>

<p>"You don't know me as I am, for though I may
love you still, I can never again be a wife to you,
and though I may suffer deeply, I shall never
change, never again. Do you realise what that
means, <i>never again</i>?"</p>

<p>He drew her slender, trembling figure towards
him, pressed her hands as if to crush them, and
said, in a stifled voice: "I will believe you! Indeed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
I will believe you!" But Luisa, gazing at him
through her tears, was not satisfied. "I <i>will</i>
believe you?" she said. "I <i>will</i> believe you?"</p>

<p>"I do believe you, I do believe you!"</p>

<p>Indeed he did believe her; but where there is
anger there is always pride as well. He did not
wish to surrender entirely, and at once, and his
tone was rather condescending than convinced.
Both were silent, holding each other's hands, and
then with a slow, almost imperceptible movement
they began to draw apart. It was Luisa who at
last gently drew away completely. She felt this
silence must be broken; he could find no glowing
words, and cold words she would not speak, so she
began to tell him how she had heard of the unfortunate
journey to Lodi from Gilardoni himself.
Seated at the table opposite her husband, she
spoke in a calm voice that was not precisely cold,
but rather grieved. While she was relating the
Professor's disclosures Franco again took fire, and
often interrupted her. "And did you not say
that to him?&mdash;And did you not say this to him?&mdash;Did
you tell him he was a fool?&mdash;Did you not call
him an ass?" At first Luisa ignored these exclamations,
but finally she protested. She had
already said that Gilardoni's blunder had filled her
with indignation, but now it would almost seem as
if her husband doubted this. Franco was reduced
to unwilling silence.</p>

<p>Her story finished, he once more stormed
against that blockhead of a philosopher, and Luisa
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
was moved to take his part. After all he was
their friend; he had indeed made a terrible mistake,
but with the best of intentions. Where
were all Franco's maxims about charity, and forgiving
injuries, if he was not willing to forgive
one whose only wish had been to benefit him?
And here thoughts came to her which she did not
utter. She reflected that Franco was ready
enough to forgive great things when there was
glory and sometimes even folly in forgiving, while
he would not now forgive a slight offence when
there were the best of reasons for doing so. When
she spoke of charity Franco became exasperated;
he did not venture to say he felt he did not deserve
a similar attack, but returned the blow somewhat
roughly. "Ah! Indeed!" he exclaimed, with a
reticence that was full of insinuations. "So you
defend him! Oh, of course!"</p>

<p>Luisa's shoulders twitched nervously, but she
held her peace.</p>

<p>"And why did you not speak!" Franco continued.
"Why did you not tell me everything at
once?"</p>

<p>"Because when I reproached Gilardoni he entreated
me not to tell. Besides, I thought&mdash;and
I was perfectly correct&mdash;that the thing being done,
it was useless to cause you such great annoyance.
The last day of the year, when you were so angry,
I wished to tell you, to relate all Gilardoni had
confided to me. Do you remember? But you
absolutely refused to listen. I did not insist,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
especially as Gilardoni had told your
grandmother we knew nothing about the matter."</p>

<p>"She did not believe him. Naturally!"</p>

<p>"And what good would it have done if I had
spoken? As it is, Pasotti must have seen plainly
that you knew nothing."</p>

<p>Franco did not answer. Then Luisa asked him
to repeat the conversation to her, and she listened
to his recital with breathless attention. She
guessed, her intuition sharpened by hatred, that
if Franco had accepted the proffered position, a
further condition would have been imposed:
separation from her uncle, from an official who had
been dismissed from service for political reasons.
"Certainly," she said, "she would have demanded
this also. <i>Canaille!</i>" Her husband started, as
if he also had been cut to the quick by that lash.
"Steady," said he. "Be careful of your expressions!
In the first place, that is only a supposition
of yours, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only a supposition? And how about the rest?
How about the cowardly action she proposed to
you?"</p>

<p>Franco, who had answered Pasotti with such
violence, now answered his wife weakly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes! But after all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was her turn to be violent now. The idea
that his grandmother should dare propose that
they forsake the uncle drove her nearly out of her
mind. "You will at least acknowledge this,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
she cried, "that she deserves no mercy? My God!
And to think that will still exists!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Franco exclaimed. "Are we to begin
over again?"</p>

<p>"<i>Let us begin over again!</i> Have you any right
to demand that I shall neither think nor feel save
in such a way as is pleasing to you? Did I obey
you I should be cowardly, I should deserve to become
a slave. And I will be neither cowardly nor
a slave!"</p>

<p>The rebel he had suspected, even felt at times
lurking behind the loving woman, the creature
possessed of an intellect intensely proud, and
stronger than love, whom he had never succeeded
in conquering completely, now stood before
him, quivering in the consciousness of her
rebellion.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said Franco, as if speaking to himself,
"so you would be cowardly, would be a slave?
Do you at least reflect that I am going away to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Do not go! Stay here! Carry out your grandfather's
wishes. Remember what you told me
concerning the origin of the Maironi wealth.
Give it all back to the Ospitale Maggiore. See
that justice is done!"</p>

<p>"No," Franco retorted. "These are idle
dreams. The end does not justify the means.
The real end with you is to strike my grandmother.
This talk of the Ospitale is simply a means of
justifying the blow. No, I will never make use of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
that will. I declared as much to Pasotti, in such
strong language that should I ever change, I
should deserve to be spit upon. I shall certainly
leave to-morrow."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, then the dialogue was
once more resumed, but the two voices were cold
and sad as if now some dead thing lay in the heart
of either.</p>

<p>"Do you realise," said Franco, "that I should be
dishonouring my own father?"</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"In the first place by the outrageous nature of
the terms in which the document is couched, and
then by implying my father's complicity in the
suppression of the will. But then you don't
understand these matters. And, after all, what
do you care?"</p>

<p>"But there is no need to speak of suppression.
It is quite possible the will was never found."</p>

<p>Another silence. Even the tallow candle that
was burning on the table had a lugubrious look.
Luisa rose, picked up the great-grandfather's
boot, and prepared to begin her work. Franco
went to the window and pressed his forehead
against the glass. He remained there some time,
absorbed in contemplation of the shadows of night.
Presently he said softly, without turning his head:</p>

<p>"Never, never has your soul been wholly mine."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Then he faced about and asked his wife in a
tone entirely free from anger, and with that ineffable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
gentleness which was his in moments of
moral or physical depression, if, since the very beginning
of their union, he had ever failed her in
any way. An almost inaudible "No" was the
answer.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you did not love me as I believed?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!"</p>

<p>Franco was not sure he had understood
correctly, and repeated:</p>

<p>"You did not love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! So dearly!"</p>

<p>His spirits began to revive, and a shade of
severity returned to his voice.</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "why did you not give me
your whole soul?"</p>

<p>She was silent. She had been trying in vain to
resume her work, but her hands trembled.</p>

<p>And now this terrible question! Should she
answer or not? By answering, by revealing for
the first time things that lay buried at the bottom
of her heart, she would only be widening the
painful gap between them; but could she be
dishonest? She was silent so long that at last
Franco said: "You will not speak?" Then she
mustered all her strength and spoke.</p>

<p>"It is true, my soul has never been wholly
yours." She trembled as she spoke the words,
and Franco held his breath.</p>

<p>"I have always felt myself different from you,
separated from you," Luisa continued, "in that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
sentiment which should govern all others. You
hold the religious views my mother held. Religion
was to my mother, as it is to you, a union of
certain beliefs, ceremonies, and precepts, inspired
and governed by the love of God. I have always
shrunk from this conception of religion; no matter
how hard I may have tried, I have never been
able to feel this love of an invisible and incomprehensible
Being; I have never been able to
understand what good could come of forcing my
reason to accept things I do not understand.
Nevertheless I felt an ardent longing to direct
my life towards what was good, according to a
disinterested ideal. Moreover, by her words and
example my mother had embued me with such a
strong sense of my duty towards God and the
Church, that my doubts caused me great pain,
and I struggled hard against them. My mother
was a saint. Every act of her life was in harmony
with her faith. This also influenced me strongly.
And then I knew that the greatest sorrow of her
life had been my father's unbelief. I met you,
loved you, married you, and I was strengthened
in my resolve to become as you are in matters of
religion, because I believed you were as my mother
was. Then, little by little, I discovered you are
not like my mother. Shall I go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to the end!"</p>

<p>"I discovered you were kindness itself, that you
had the warmest, most generous heart in the
world, but that your faith and your religious
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
practices rendered these treasures almost useless.
You did not strive! You were satisfied to love me,
the child, Italy, your flowers, your music, the
beauty of the lake and the mountains. In this
you followed your heart. As to a higher ideal,
it was sufficient for you to believe and to pray.
Without this faith and without these prayers you
would have given the fire that is in your soul to
that which is surely true, which is surely just in
this world, you would have felt the same need to be
doing that I feel. You are well aware, are you
not, what I could have wished you to be in certain
things? For example, who feels patriotism more
keenly than you do? Surely no one. Well, I
could have wished to see you endeavour to serve
your country seriously, and according to your
strength. Now you are indeed going to Piedmont,
but your principal reason for doing so is that we
have hardly anything left to live upon."</p>

<p>Franco, frowning angrily, made an impatient
gesture of protest. "If you wish it I will stop,"
Luisa said humbly.</p>

<p>"No, no. Go on! Let us have the whole of it!
It will be better!"</p>

<p>He spoke so excitedly, so angrily, that Luisa
was silent, and it was only after a second, "Go
on!" that she continued.</p>

<p>"Without going to Piedmont there would have
been enough to do here in Valsolda, in Val Porlezza,
in Vall' Intelvi; what V. does on the Lake
of Como, communicating with different people,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
keeping the right spirit alive, preparing all that
must be prepared against the coming of war, if,
indeed, it ever comes. I used to tell you so, but
you would not be convinced, you saw so many
difficulties in the way. This sluggishness fostered
my repugnance to your conception of religion,
and my tendency towards another conception.
For I also felt myself intensely religious.
The conception of religion which was gradually
shaping itself clearly in my mind was, in substance,
as follows: God really exists, and is powerful
and wise as you believe, but He is perfectly
indifferent to our adoration of Him, and prayers to
Him. What He demands of us is what we may
learn from the heart he has formed for each one
of us, from the conscience He has given us, from
the surroundings in which He has placed us. He
wishes us to love all that is good, to hate all that
is evil, to labour with all our strength, according
to this love and this hatred, and to occupy ourselves
exclusively with the things of this world, with
things we can comprehend, that can be felt!
Now you will understand what my idea really is of
my duty, of our duty, in the face of all injustice,
all tyranny!"</p>

<p>The further she went in this definition, this
exposure of her own views, the greater was the
relief she experienced in so doing, in being perfectly
sincere at last, in frankly taking her stand
on her own firm ground, and gradually all indignation
against her husband died down within
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
her, and in her heart there arose a tender pity for
him.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she added, "if it had been only this
trouble about your grandmother, do you think I
would not rather have sacrificed my own opinion
a thousand times, rather than grieve you? There
was something else underlying that. Now you
know all. Now I have laid my bare soul in your
hands."</p>

<p>She read dull pain and hostile coldness on her
husband's brow. She rose and moved towards
him very slowly, with clasped hands, gazing at
him, seeking his eyes, which avoided hers, and
then halted on the way, repulsed by some higher
power, for he had neither spoken nor made a
gesture.</p>

<p>"Franco!" she entreated, "can you no longer
love me?"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Franco! Franco!" she cried, stretching out
her clasped hands. Then she started to move
forward. He drew back with a rapid movement.
Thus they stood in silence, face to face, for half a
minute that seemed an eternity.</p>

<p>Franco's lips were pressed tight together, and
she could hear his quick breathing. It was he
who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"What you have said is exactly what you feel?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>His hands were clutching the back of a chair.
He shook it violently, saying bitterly: "Enough!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Luisa looked at him with inexpressible sadness,
and murmured: "Enough?" He answered angrily,
"Enough, enough, enough!" After a moment's
silence he went on harshly: "I may be indolent,
sluggish, selfish, anything you like, but I am
not a boy to be soothed by a couple of caresses after
all you have said to me. Enough, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Franco! I know I have hurt you, but it
has cost me so much, having to hurt you! Can't
you take me kindly?"</p>

<p>"Ah, take you kindly, indeed! You wish to be
free to inflict any wound, and then expect to be
taken kindly! You are superior to every one
else! You judge, you pass sentence, you alone
understand what God wishes and what He does
not wish? But this at least I will not have!
Say whatever you like about me, but let those
things you do not understand alone. You had
better be working on your boot!"</p>

<p>He was determined to see only pride in his wife,
while his own anger was born almost wholly of
pride, of outraged self-esteem; it was an impure
anger which darkened his brain and his heart.
Both husband and wife would have acknowledged
the justice of any other accusation sooner than that
of pride.</p>

<p>She silently resumed her seat and tried to resume
her work as well, but she handled the tools
nervously without really knowing what she was
doing. Franco went into the hall, banging the
door behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
    It was very cold in the darkness of the hall which
had been unoccupied since five o'clock, but Franco
did not notice this. He threw himself upon the
sofa, giving himself up entirely to his grief, to his
anger, to an easy and violent mental defence of
himself against his wife. As Luisa had rebelled
against God and against himself&mdash;though indeed
she had made a distinction&mdash;he now found it convenient
to make common cause in his heart with
that other mute and terrible One whom she had
offended. At first astonishment, bitterness, rage,
good reasons and bad, formed a whirling tempest
in his brain. Then he found relief for his feelings
in imagining Luisa's repentance, her prayers for
forgiveness, and his own magnanimous answers.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard Maria screaming and crying.
He rose to go and see what had happened, but he
was without a light. He waited a moment thinking
Luisa would go out, but he did not hear her
move, and the child was screaming louder than
ever. Very softly he went towards the parlour,
and looked in through the glass door.</p>

<p>Luisa had hidden her face in her arms, which
were crossed on the table, and the light of the
candle revealed only her beautiful dark hair.
Franco felt his anger cooling, he opened the door,
and called softly, his tone still gently severe:
"Luisa, Maria is crying." Luisa raised her face,
which was very pale, took the candle and went out
without a word. Her husband followed her.
They found the child sitting up in bed bathed in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
tears; a dream had frightened her. When she
saw her father she stretched out her arms to him.
"Not go away, papa, not go away!" she entreated,
her voice big with tears. Franco pressed her in
his arms, covered her with kisses, soothed her,
and then put her back into her little bed. But
she clung tightly to one of her father's hands, and
could not be prevailed upon to let it go.</p>

<p>Luisa took another candle from the table and
tried to light it, but her hands shook so she did
not succeed. "Are you not coming to bed?"
Franco asked. "No," she said, trembling more
violently than ever. Franco thought he divined
a supposition, a fear in her, and was offended.
"Oh, you can come!" he said angrily. Luisa
lighted her candle and said, more calmly, that she
must work on the little shoes. She went out, and
only on the threshold did she murmur: "Good-night."
"Good-night," Franco answered coldly.
For a moment he thought he would undress, but
he presently relinquished his intention because
his wife was still up, and at work. He spread
back the coverlet and lay down in his clothes, on
the side of the bed next to the child, that he
might hold Maria's little hand&mdash;she had not yet
gone to sleep&mdash;and put out the light.</p>

<p>What sweetness in the touch of that dear, tiny
hand! Franco felt her the little child she was,
his daughter, the innocent, loving baby, and then
he imagined her a woman, her heart all his,
united to him in every thought, every sentiment,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
and he fancied the little hand that pressed his
was striving to compensate him for all that Luisa
had made him suffer, and was saying: "Papa,
you and I are united for ever!" Good God! he
shuddered at the thought that Luisa might wish to
bring her up in her own way of thinking, and that
he, being far away, would be powerless to prevent
this. He prayed to God, to the Virgin Mary, to
the saintly grandmother Teresa, to his own
mother, who, he was well aware, had been so pure
and so pious. "Watch over my Maria, watch
over her!" he murmured. He offered to sacrifice
his whole being, his earthly happiness, his health,
even life itself, that Maria might be saved from
error.</p>

<p>"Papa," said the child, "a kiss."</p>

<p>He leaned out of bed, and, bending down,
sought the dear little face in the dark, and told her
to be quiet, to go to sleep. She was silent for a
moment, and then called&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got the mule under my pillow, you
know, papa."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear, but now go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I am going to sleep."</p>

<p>Once more she was silent for a moment and
then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is mamma in bed, papa?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
    "Because she is making little shoes for you."</p>

<p>"Shall I wear shoes in heaven also, like great
grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Tell me a story, papa."</p>

<p>He tried, but he had neither Luisa's imagination
nor her skill, and soon came to a stand-still.
"Oh, papa!" said Maria, in a compassionate tone,
"you don't know how to tell stories."</p>

<p>This was humiliating. "Listen, listen!" he
answered, and began reciting a ballad by Carrer,
always going back to the beginning after the first
four lines, which were all he knew of it, his expression
becoming ever more mysterious, his voice
ever fainter, until it was only an inarticulate
murmur, and thus at last Signorina Missipipì,
lulled by the rhythm of the lines, passed with
them into the world of dreams. When he heard
her sleeping peacefully it seemed to him he was
so cruel to leave her, he felt himself such a traitor,
that he wavered in his resolve. He at once controlled
himself, however.</p>

<p>The sweet dialogue with the child had greatly
soothed him and raised his spirits. He began to
be conscious of an imperative duty towards his
wife which would henceforth be incumbent upon
him. He must show himself a man, both in will
and in deed, and this at the cost of any sacrifice.
He must defend his faith against her by his works,
by leaving home, by labour and suffering; and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;if Almighty God should see fit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
to allow the cannon to roar for Italy, he must push
ever to the front; and let the Austrian ball come,
if it but teach her to weep and pray at last!</p>

<p>He remembered that he had not said his evening
prayers. Poor Franco, he had never been
able to say them in bed without dropping off to
sleep before they were half finished. Feeling
comparatively calm, and reflecting that it might
perhaps be some time before Luisa came to bed,
he feared he should go to sleep, and what would
she say if she found him sleeping? He rose very
softly and said his prayers; then he lighted the
candle and sat down at the writing-desk, intending
to read, but presently he fell asleep in his
chair.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>He was aroused by the beat of Veronica's
wooden shoes on the stairs. Luisa was not yet
come. Soon, however, she entered the room, and
expressed no surprise at seeing Franco already
up.</p>

<p>"It is four o'clock," she said. "If you intend
to start, you have only half an hour's time."
He must leave home at half-past four, to be sure
of reaching Menaggio in time for the first boat
coming from Colico. Instead of going to Como
and thence to Milan as had been officially announced,
Franco was to leave the steamer
at Argegno and go up to S. Fedele, coming down
into Switzerland by Val Mara or by Orimento and
Monte Generoso.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
    Franco signed to his wife to be quiet, that she
might not disturb Maria. Then with another
silent gesture he called her to him.</p>

<p>"I am going," he said. "Last night I was
harsh with you. I beg you to forgive me. I
should have answered you differently, even though
I was in the right. You know my temperament.
Forgive me! At least, do not let us part in anger."</p>

<p>"For my part I feel none," Luisa answered
gently, as one who finds it easy to condescend,
because he feels himself superior.</p>

<p>The final preparations were made in silence;
breakfast was eaten in silence. Franco went to
embrace the uncle to whom he had not said good-bye
the night before; then he returned to the
alcove-room alone, and kneeling beside the little
bed, touched with his lips a tiny hand that was
hanging over the edge. Upon returning to the
parlour he found Luisa in shawl and hat, and
asked if she were going to Porlezza also. Yes,
she was going. Everything was ready. Luisa
had the handbag, the valise was in the boat, and
Ismaele was waiting on the stairs of the boathouse,
one foot on the step, the other on the prow of the
boat.</p>

<p>Veronica accompanied the travellers with a
light, and wished her master a pleasant journey,
with a crestfallen expression, for she had an
inkling of the quarrel.</p>

<p>Two minutes later and the heavy boat, pushed
forward by Ismaele's slow and steady "travelling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
strokes," was passing beneath the wall of the
kitchen-garden. Franco put his head out of the
little window. The rose-bushes, the caper-bushes,
and the aloes hanging from the wall, passed
slowly in the pale light of this starry but moonless
night; then the orange-trees, the medlar, and the
pine slipped by. Good-bye! Good-bye! They
passed the cemetery, the <i>Zocca di Mainè</i>, the
narrow lane where he had so often walked with
Maria, the Tavorell. Franco no longer watched.
The light that usually burned in the little cabin
was not there to-night, and he could not see his
wife, who was silent.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Porlezza about those papers of
the notary's, or simply to accompany me?" he said.</p>

<p>"This too!" Luisa murmured sadly. "I tried
to be strictly honest with you, and you took
offence. You ask my forgiveness, and now you
say such things as this to me. I see that one
cannot be faithful to truth without great, great
suffering. But patience! I have chosen that
path now. You will know soon whether I really
came on your account or not. Do not humble
me by making me say so now."</p>

<p>"<i>Do not humble me!</i>" Franco exclaimed. "I
do not understand. We are indeed different in
so many ways. My God, how different we are!
You are always so completely mistress of yourself,
you can always express your thoughts so
exactly, they are always so clear, so cool."</p>

<p>Luisa murmured: "Yes, we are different."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
    Neither spoke again until they reached Cressogno.
When they were near the Marchesa's villa
Luisa began to talk, and tried to keep the conversation
alive until they should have left the villa
behind. She asked him to repeat to her the itinerary
that had been arranged for his journey, and
suggested that he take only his handbag with him,
for the valise would be a burden from Argegno on.
She had already spoken to Ismaele about it, and he
had promised to carry it to Lugano and send it
on to Turin from that place. Meanwhile they had
passed his grandmother's villa.</p>

<p>Now the sanctuary of Caravina came in sight.
Twice during their courtship Franco and Luisa
had met under those olive-trees, at the <i>festa</i> of
Caravina, on the eighth of September. And now
the dear little church in its grove of olives, beneath
the awful rocks of the peak of Cressogno,
was left behind also. Farewell, little church.
Farewell to the past!</p>

<p>"Remember," Franco said, almost harshly,
"that Maria is to say her prayers every morning
and evening. It is an order I give you."</p>

<p>"I should have made her do so without this
order," Luisa answered. "I know Maria does
not belong to me alone."</p>

<p>Then they were silent all the way to Porlezza.
Coming forth from the tranquil bay of Valsolda,
seeing other valleys, other horizons, the lake just
rippled by the first breath of dawn, the two
travellers were drawn towards other thoughts,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
were led to think, without knowing why, of the
uncertain future, which must bring great events,
of which prophetic whisperings already circulated
mysteriously through the heavy Austrian silence.
Some one called out from the shore at Porlezza,
and Ismaele began to row rapidly. It was
the driver, Toni Pollin, who was shouting to
them to make haste if they wished to catch the
steamer at Menaggio.</p>

<p>The last moments had come. Franco let down
the window in the little door, and looked at the
man as if he were most anxious not to lose a word.</p>

<p>When they touched the shore he turned to his
wife. "Are you going to get out also?" "If
you wish it," she said. They alighted. A cabriolet
stood ready on the shore. "By the way,"
said Luisa, "you will find some lunch in your bag."
They embraced, exchanging a cold and rapid
kiss in the presence of three or four curious bystanders
"Try and make Maria forgive me for
leaving her thus," said Franco, and they were
his last words, for Toni Pollin was hurrying them:
"Quick, quick!" The horse started off at a brisk
trot, and the cabriolet rattled noisily, with a
great snapping of the whip, through the dark and
narrow street of Porlezza.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Franco was on board the <i>Falcon</i> between Campo
and Argegno when he thought of his lunch. He
opened the bag, and his heart gave a bound as he
perceived a letter bearing as an address the words
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
"For You" in his wife's hand. He tore it open
eagerly, and read as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you only knew what I am experiencing in
my soul, how I am suffering, how sorely I am
tempted to lay aside the little shoes&mdash;in the
making of which I am far less skilful than you
think&mdash;and to go to you, taking back all I have
said, you would not be so harsh with me. I must
have sinned deeply against truth, that the first
steps I now take in following her are so difficult,
so bitter.</p>

<p>"You think me proud, and I believed myself
very sensitive, but now I feel that your humiliating
words alone could not have kept me from
hastening to you. What holds me back is a Voice
within me, a Voice stronger than I am, which
commands me to sacrifice everything save my
consciousness of truth.</p>

<p>"Ah! I hope this sacrifice may bring its reward!
I hope that one day there may be a perfect
union between our two souls.</p>

<p>"I am going into the garden to gather for you
that brave little rose we admired together the
other day, the little rose that has challenged and
conquered January. Do you remember how
many obstacles lay between us the first time I
received a flower from your hand? I was not yet
in love with you, but you already dreamt of
winning me. Now it is I who hope to win you!"</p>

<p>Franco came near letting the steamer pass
Argegno without moving from his seat.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
FOR BREAD, FOR ITALY, FOR GOD</h2>

<p>Eight months later, in September, 1855,
Franco was occupying a miserable attic in
Via Barbaroux, Turin. In February he had obtained
the post of translator for the <i>Opinione</i>,
with a monthly salary of eighty-five lire. Later
he began to write the parliamentary reports, and
his salary was raised to a hundred lire. Dina,
the manager of the paper, was fond of him, and
procured him extra work outside the office, thus
adding twenty-five or thirty lire to his earnings.
Franco lived on sixty lire a month. The rest
went to Lugano to be carried thence to Oria by
the faithful hands of Ismaele. To live a month
on sixty lire took more courage than Franco himself
had believed he possessed. The hours at the
office, the translating&mdash;a laborious task for one
full of scruples and literary timidity&mdash;weighed
more heavily upon him than the privations; moreover
he felt even sixty lire was too large a sum,
and reproached himself for not being able to do
with less.</p>

<p>He had attached himself to six other refugees,
some of whom were Lombards, others Venetians.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
They ate together, walked together, conversed together.
With the exception of Franco and a
young man from Udine, all the others were between
thirty and forty years of age. All were
extremely poor, and not one of them had ever
consented to accept a penny from the Piedmontese
Government as a subsidy. The young man
from Udine came of a rich family, of Austrian
tendencies, and received not a penny from home.
He was a good flutist, gave four or five lessons
a week, and played in the small orchestras of
second-rate theatres. A notary from Padua was
copyist in Boggio's office. A lawyer from Caprino,
Bergamasco, who had seen service at Rome in
1849, was book-keeper at a large establishment in
Via Nuovo, where umbrellas and walking-sticks
were sold, and for this reason his friends had
dubbed him "the knave of clubs." A fourth, a
Milanese, had been through the campaign of 1848
as one of Carlo Alberto's scouts. His present
occupation was to quarrel continually with "the
knave of clubs," for reasons of provincial rivalry,
to teach fencing in a couple of boarding schools,
and in winter to play the piano behind a mysterious
curtain in halls where polkas were danced
at a penny each. The others lived on insufficient
allowances from their families. All except Franco
were unmarried, and all were gay. They called
themselves, and were called by others, the "seven
wise men," and in their wisdom they dominated
Turin from the elevated positions of seven attics,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
scattered all over the city from Borgo San Dalmazzo
to Piazza Milano.</p>

<p>Franco's was the most wretched of these attics,
the rent being only seven lire a month. No
member of this band had any services whatsoever
performed for them, save the notary from
Padua, for whom the doorkeeper's sister carried
water to his attic, and had he not been the calm
philosopher he was, the merciless teasings of his
friends would have made him regret Marga's
devotion. They all cleaned their own boots.
The most skilful with his hands was Franco, and
it was his lot to sew on his friends' buttons when
they did not wish to humble themselves by applying
to the lawyer and his Marga, who, nevertheless,
often had her hands full, "poor, overworked
woman that I am!" The young man from Udine
had a sweetheart, a little <i>tota</i><a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> from the first booth
in Piazza Castello on the corner of Po, but he was
jealous, and would not allow her to sew on buttons
for any one. The friends took their revenge by
calling her "the puppet," because she sold puppets
and dolls. However, thanks to "the puppet,"
he was the only member of the band whose clothes
were always in order, and whose cravat was always
tied in a graceful knot. They took their meals at
a restaurant in Vanchiglia, which they had christened
"Stomach-ache Tavern," and where they
had lunch and dinner for thirty lire a month.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Their only extravagance was the <i>bicierîn</i>, a mixture
of coffee, milk, and chocolate, costing only
fifteen centimes. They drank this in the morning,
the Venetians at the Café Alfieri, the others at
Café Florio. All except Franco, however. He
went without the <i>bicierîn</i> and the <i>torcètt</i>, a cake
costing a penny that went with it, in order that
he might lay by enough for a little trip to Lugano,
and a trifling present for Maria. In the winter
they walked under the porticoes of Po, the "wise
ones" in the vicinity of the University, while the
more light-minded frequented the porticoes on
the San Francesco side. After their walk they
would go to a coffee-house, where the one whose
turn it was would sip a cup of coffee, while the
others read the newspapers and looted the sugar
basin. Once a week, to satisfy the "knave of
clubs," they would betake themselves to a den
in Via Bertola, where the purest and most exquisite
Giambava wine was to be had.</p>

<p>The flutist from Udine of course went to the
theatres, and by his means some of the others went
<i>gratis</i> from time to time, but always to the play,
and usually either to the Rossini or Gerbino
theatres. For Franco to be obliged to pass the
posters at the Regio and the other opera houses
was a far greater trial than to be obliged to clean
his own boots and lunch off two square inches of
omelet that was so thin it would have served
admirably to observe the spots on the sun through.
He had had the good fortune to make the acquaintance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of a certain C., a Venetian, who was
secretary at the department of Public Works, and
who presented him to the family of a most distinguished
major in the sanitary corps, also
Venetian, and who owned a piano and was in the
habit of receiving a few friends of an evening, on
which occasions he would regale them with a cup
of most excellent coffee of a quality almost unique
in the Turin of those days. When, for one reason
or another, the "seven wise men" did not spend
the evening together, Franco would go to this
gentleman's house in Piazza Milano, to make
music, to converse on art with the daughters, or to
discuss politics with his hostess, a fierce Venetian
patriot, a woman of great talents, and possessed
of a strenuous soul, who had not only borne heroically
all the hardships and the bitterness of exile,
but had sustained the courage of her husband,
whose first steps had been most painful and
difficult; for those precious, honest old numskulls
of the inflexible Piedmontese administration had
actually obliged this already famous professor of
the University of Padua to submit to an examination,
before they would admit him into
the army as surgeon.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>The correspondence between Turin and Oria did
not indeed reflect the true state of mind of Franco
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and Luisa; it ran on smoothly and affectionately
enough, but with great caution and reserve on
either side. Luisa had expected that Franco
would answer her note, and resume the great discussion.
As he never mentioned either the note
or what had passed between them that last night,
she risked an allusion. It was allowed to pass
unheeded. As a matter of fact Franco had several
times started to write with the intention of confuting
his wife's opinions. Before beginning he
always felt himself strong, and was convinced
that with a little thought he could easily discover
crushing arguments, and, indeed, arguments he
believed to be such would rush to his pen, but
when they were set down in writing, he would at
once be forced to recognise their inadequacy.
Though surprised and grieved he would make
another attempt, but always with the same
result. Nevertheless his wife was certainly in
error; this he never for a moment doubted, and
there must be a way of demonstrating it to her.
He must study. But what, and how? He consulted
a priest to whom he had been to confession
soon after his arrival in Turin. This priest, a
little misshapen old man, who was fiery and very
learned, invited him to his house in Piazza Paisana,
and began to help him enthusiastically, suggesting
a number of books, some for his own perusal,
and others to be sent to his wife. He was a
learned Orientalist, and an enthusiastic Thomist,
and had taken a great fancy to Franco, of whose
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
genius and culture he had formed an opinion which
was perhaps exaggeratedly favourable. At one
time he was on the point of proposing to him the
study of Hebrew, and indeed insisted upon his
reading St. Thomas. He went so far as to sketch
for Franco the outlines of a letter to his wife, with
a list of the arguments he must expound. Franco
had at once fallen in love with the enthusiastic
little old man, who, moreover, had the pure expression
of a saint. He began to study St.
Thomas with great ardour, but did not persevere
long. He felt he was embarking upon a sea without
beginning and without end, across which he
was unable to steer a straight course. The
scholastic scheme of treatment, that sameness in
the form of argument for and against, that icy
Latin, dense with profound thought, and colourless
on the surface, had successfully routed all his good
intentions at the end of three days. Of the arguments
contained in the sketch for the letter he
understood only a small part. He got the priest
to explain them to him, understood somewhat
better, and prepared to open a campaign with
them, but found himself as much encumbered by
them as was David by the armour of Saul. They
weighed upon him, he could not handle them, he
felt they were not his own and never would be.
No, he could not present himself before his wife
with Professor G.'s priestly hat and tunic, a theological
lance in his hand, and entrenched behind
a shield of metaphysics. He recognised that he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
was not born to philosophise in any way; he was
destitute of the very power of strictly logical
reasoning, for indeed his glowing heart, rich in
tenderness and indignation, would too often interfere,
speaking for or against, according to its own
passions. One evening at Casa C. he was playing
the <i>andante</i> of Beethoven's twenty-eighth sonata,
when, with quivering nerves and flashing eyes,
he said in a low tone: "Ah! This, this, this!"
He was reflecting that no theologian, no doctor,
could communicate the religious sentiment as
Beethoven does. As he played on he put his
whole soul into the music, and longed for Luisa's
presence that he might play this divine <i>andante</i>
to her, that he might unite himself to her, praying
thus in an ineffable spasm of the spirit. But he
did not reflect that Luisa who, moreover, was far
less sensitive to music than he was, would probably
have attributed another meaning to the <i>andante</i>,
that of the painful conflict between our
affections and our convictions.</p>

<p>He went to G., returned the works of St. Thomas
and confessed his utter incapacity in such humble
and feeling language, that after a few moments of
frowning and uneasy silence, the old priest forgave
him. "There, there, there!" said he, resignedly
taking back the first volume of the
<i>Somma</i>. "Commend yourself to our Lord, and
let us hope He Himself will act." Thus ended
Franco's theological studies.</p>

<p>All this pondering of his wife's opinions and his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
own, and above all the Professor's advice: "Commend
yourself to our Lord," were not fruitless.
He began to see that on some points Luisa was
not mistaken. When she had reproached him for
not leading a life in conformity with his faith, he
had been more offended by this than by anything
else. Now a generous impulse carried him to
the other extreme; he judged himself severely,
exaggerated his faults of idleness, of anger, even
of greed, and held himself responsible for Luisa's
intellectual aberrations. He felt a desire to tell
her this, to humble himself before her, to separate
his own cause from the cause of God. When he
obtained his position on the <i>Opinione</i>, and regulated
his own expenses in such a manner as to be
able to make an allowance to his family, his wife
wrote that this allowance was entirely too large
in proportion to his earnings, and that the thought
of him, living in Turin on sixty lire a month,
gave her own food a bitter taste. He answered&mdash;and
this was not strictly true&mdash;that in the first
place, he never went hungry, but that he would,
indeed, be glad to fast, because he felt an intense
desire to change his way of life, to expiate his past
idleness, including the hours he had wasted on
his flowers and music, to expiate all past softness,
all past weaknesses, including the weakness for
dainty dishes and fine wines. He added that he
had asked God's forgiveness for this past life, and
that he felt he must ask her forgiveness also. In fact
the Paduan, with whom Franco had become very intimate,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and to whom he read this passage in his letter
as a sort of confirmation of previous confessions,
exclaimed: "That bit sounds for all the world
like the oration of Manasseh, king of Judæa!"</p>

<p>Luisa wrote most affectionately, but with less
effusion. Franco's silence on the painful subject
displeased her, and she felt it would be unwise on
her part to allude to it in the face of a silence so
obstinate.</p>

<p>His good intentions concerning labour and
self-sacrifice moved her deeply; when she read
that confession of great wickedness, followed by
the prayer for pardon to God and to herself, she
smiled and kissed the letter, feeling that this was
an act of submission, and a humble acceptance of
the censure which had at first only irritated him.
Poor Franco! These were the impulses of his
noble, generous nature! But would they last?
She answered at once, and if her emotion was
apparent in her answer, so also was her smile,
which displeased Franco. At the end he found
these words: "When I read your many self-accusations
I thought, with remorse, of the
accusations I brought against you, one sad night,
and I felt that you also had been thinking of
them as you wrote, although neither in this letter
nor in any other are they alluded to. I deeply
regret those accusations, my own Franco, but
how I wish we could speak together as true friends,
concerning those other questions of which I
think so much here in my solitude!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
    Luisa's wish remained ungratified. In answering
Franco did not even touch on this point;
indeed his next letter was somewhat cool, so
Luisa did not again revert to the subject. Only
once, when speaking of Maria, did she write:
"If you could only see how Maria recites her 'Our
Father' every night and morning, and how well
she behaves at Mass, on Sundays, you would be
satisfied."</p>

<p>He replied: "As to what you tell me concerning
Maria's religious exercises, I am satisfied, and I
thank you!"</p>

<p>Both Luisa and Franco wrote almost every day,
and sent their letters once a week. Ismaele went
to the post at Lugano every Tuesday, taking the
wife's letters and bringing back the husband's.
In June Maria had the measles, and in August
Uncle Piero lost the sight of his left eye, almost
without warning, and for some time was greatly
distressed. During these two periods the letters
from Oria were more frequent, but in September
the weekly correspondence was resumed. From
the bundle of letters I take the last that passed
between Franco and Luisa, on the eve of those
events which overwhelmed them at the end of
September.</p>

<p>"I do not think Pasotti will ever come to our
house again. I am sorry on poor Barborin's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
account, for I fear she will not be able to come
either, but I do not regret what I did.</p>

<p>"He has known perfectly well for some time that
you are in Turin. He even talked of it with the
Receiver, so Maria Pon told me. She was in the
Romit chapel, and heard them talking on their
way down from Albogasio Superiore. When he
came here he would always pretend not to know,
and would enquire for you with his usual assumption
of interest and friendship. To-day he
found me alone in the little garden and asked how
much longer you would be absent and whether you
were in Milan at present. I answered frankly
that his question surprised me. He turned pale.
'Why?' said he. 'Because you have been
going about saying that Franco is in an entirely
different place.' He became confused and protested
angrily. 'You may protest as much as
you like!' I said. 'It is quite useless. You
know that. At all events Franco is very well off
where he is. You may say as much to whomever
you please.' 'You wish to insult me!' he exclaimed.
I did not stop to think long, but retorted:
'That is quite possible!' Then he rushed
away without saluting me, and looking as black
as the ace of spades&mdash;that simile suits my present
mood! I am sure he will go to Cressogno this
evening.</p>

<p>"Cüstant has sent us a present of a magnificent
tench which he caught this morning, much to the
chagrin of Bianconi, who fishes all day long, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
never catches anything. He is furious with the impudent
tench because they snap their fingers&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;at His Imperial and Royal Majesty of Austria
and his Carlascia. 'Poor fellow!' says Signora
Peppina. 'He is eating his heart out!'</p>

<p>"However, he will get over it, he will get over it.</p>

<div class="signature">"<i>September 15.</i></div>

<p>"I related the Pasotti episode to Uncle Piero and
he was very much annoyed. 'Much good this
will do you!' he said. Poor Uncle! One might
almost suspect him of being a utilitarian, whereas
he is really a philosopher. After all the strongest
argument he ever opposes to all my burning indignation
against the many ugly things in this
world is: 'Worrying won't mend it!'</p>

<p>"To-day the parish Mass was said at Albogasio
Superiore. In coming out of church with Maria I
caught a despairing glance from poor Barborin,
who evidently had orders to avoid me. However,
Ester walked down with us and coming into
the house told me privately something I have been
expecting to hear. She began by begging me not
to laugh, while all the time she was laughing herself.
I succeeded in gathering that the Professor,
by dint of great perseverance, has overcome her
resistance, although Ester still declares she does
not know her own mind.</p>

<p>"'It is his nose!' she said this morning, laughing
and hiding her gay little face. Indeed that
scandalous nose seems to me to be prospering;
it is redder than ever, and grows ever larger!</p>

<div class="signature">"<i>September 18.</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></div>

<p>"I have not written for three days, fearing I
should not be mistress of my pen, nor be able to
confine my thoughts within words which must not
exceed certain bounds. Now I feel equal to the
task, and so I will set about it. But I must
warn you, Franco, that I am not sure of being able
to control my feelings all the way through.</p>

<p>"Well, then, your grandmother's agent came to
me on the evening of the fifteenth. As the half-yearly
payment of your income is due on the sixteenth,
I concluded he had come to bring the five
hundred <i>svanziche</i>, and so I told him at once that
I would go and prepare the receipt for him. Then
the most gracious Signor Bellini informed me that
my receipt would not be sufficient. 'How can
that be?' I said. 'It was sufficient on the sixteenth
of March.' 'I don't know,' he replied. 'I have
my orders.' 'But Franco is not here.' 'I know
that.' 'Then what did you come here for?' 'I came
to tell you that if Don Franco wishes to draw his
money he must present himself at the Signora Marchesa's
agency in Brescia.' 'And what if he cannot
go to Brescia?' Here Signor Bellini made a
gesture that meant, 'That is your affair.' I
replied that it was all right, had coffee brought
for him, and told him I was anxious to purchase
the book-shelves in your old study at Cressogno
from the Signora Marchesa. Bellini turned yellow,
and sneaked away like our old dog Pato at Casa
Rigey when he had been stealing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
    "Most certainly the worthy Pasotti has had
a finger in this dirty business.</p>

<p>"The Prefect of Caravina was here yesterday and
told us that Pasotti went to Cressogno on the
evening of the fourteenth. He was very late, and
reached your grandmother's house while they were
saying the rosary, so he had to mumble the prayers
with the others, which greatly amused the prefect,
for it is his opinion that Pasotti goes to Mass
simply because he is an Imperial and Royal
pensioner, but that his only prayer is 'the rats'
Pater,' whatever that may be. He added that
after the others had gone out Pasotti remained in
confabulation with your grandmother, and that
Bellini was also present. Bellini had arrived that
very day from Brescia. He probably brought
the money for you.</p>

<p>"We have enough left to live upon until the
money comes from you in October. That is all
I wish to say.</p>

<p>"Maria sends you the cyclamen you will find enclosed.
I must also tell you the following incident.
You can fancy she notices the state of mind I am
in. She often hears me discussing the subject
with Uncle Piero. The uncle is always the uncle!
In his whole life he has set down as rascals only
such contractors as offered him bribes, and
another uncle his exact opposite, who, after
making use of his nephew for many years, died
without leaving him so much as a dried fig. He
would never recognise any other rascals, nor will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
he do so even now. Well, when I am talking with
him, Maria always wants to listen. I send her
away, but I sometimes fail to notice that she has
returned very softly. This morning she began
saying her prayers. Oh, Franco! your daughter
is indeed very religious in your own way! The
last prayer she repeats is a <i>requiem</i> for poor Grandmamma
Teresa. 'Mamma,' said she when she
had finished, 'I want to recite a <i>requiem</i> for the
grandmother in Cressogno also.' Never mind my
answer. My words were bitter; perhaps I did
wrong; I am even ready to confess I did wrong.
Maria looked at me, and said: 'Is the grandmother
at Cressogno really wicked?' 'Yes.'
'But why does Uncle Piero say she is not really
wicked?' 'Because Uncle Piero is so very good.'
'Then you are not so very good?' My dear little
innocent! I devoured her with kisses, I could not
help it! As soon as she was free to speak she began
again: 'You will not go to Paradise, you
know, if you are not so very good.' Paradise is
her one idea. Poor Franco, not to have her with
you, you who would be so satisfied with her!
You are indeed making a great sacrifice! If it
will give you any pleasure I will tell you that the
only possibility for me to love God is through
this child, for in her God becomes visible and intelligible
to me.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Franco. I embrace you.</p>

<div class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Luisa.</span></div>

<p>"P. S. I must tell you that I have dismissed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
Veronica for the first of October. This I did in
the first place for reasons of economy, and secondly
because I have discovered that she is flirting
with a customs-guard. Oh! I almost forgot something
else! Half an hour ago Ester came to tell
me she has decided to say 'yes,' but she wishes
to wait a day longer before seeing the Professor.
She has evidently succeeded in swallowing the
nose, but has not yet digested it."</p>

<div class="signature4"><span class="smcap">Franco to Luisa.</span></div>

<div class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Turin</span>, <i>September 14, 1855</i>.</div>

<p>"The 'knave of clubs' is threatened with dismissal
by his employer on account of the truly
miserable state of his clothes. The 'knave'
is indeed given to extravagance, and has not yet
learned&mdash;<i>duris in rebus</i>&mdash;to handle a clothes brush,
but however that may be, the other 'wise men'
have decided not to lunch for a week in order that
he may re-clothe himself. Now observe the
baseness of the human heart! The 'knave,'
overflowing with expressions of gratitude, calmly
prepared to go to his own lunch! This, however,
we would not stand. So to-day, instead of repairing
to Stomach-ache Tavern, we spent half
an hour on the banks of the Po, near the Valentino,
watching the water flow past. The wise man from
Udine had brought his flute with him, because
music should not be wanting at an ideal lunch, at
which the most Irimalchionian ideas of food and
beverages are handed round. He also had with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
him a letter from his family, containing magnificent
proposals for his return to the fold. They
even offer him a riding-horse. He says he has
written them that they will soon see him come
dashing up on one of King Victor Emmanuel's
horses. Then the Paduan, who is a wag, said to
him with a great assumption of seriousness, "Ah,
my hero! So you are beginning to blow your own
trumpet as well as play the flute!" The flutist
was wild, but presently he calmed down, and
played us a nice little tune. The strange part of
it all is that none of us felt hungry. However,
when the meeting was adjourned, we decided
that the 'knave's' clothing should be simplified,
and that he could get along without the <i>justicoat</i>,
known in modern parlance as the waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Ah! We would all gladly do without dinner as
well as lunch if we could only cross the Ticino with
the King in April, 1856! We talked of this on our
way back to the city after the ideal lunch. The
Paduan observed that the water is too cold in
April and that we had better wait until the end of
June. We began to talk about how great Italy
will be without the Germans. I assure you we
were all enthusiastic, in spite of the emptiness of
our stomachs. All except the Paduan of course,
but of him I must tell you that if he is reduced
almost to the verge of starvation, it is because he
will not tolerate the Austrians, and that although
he is knocking at the door of forty, he will fight
better than some of these young fellows who are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
now devouring an Austrian for lunch, and two for
dinner! He says we shall once more become a cat
and dog kingdom. 'Mark this, for example,'
he added. 'When the Germans shall have departed,
each of us will return to his own home,
and woe to you if you come and worry me in
Padua!' I can almost fancy I am listening to
Uncle Piero, when, at Oria, we used to discuss the
greatness and the splendid future of Italy. 'Yes,
yes, yes!' he would say, 'Yes, yes, yes! The lake
will turn into milk and honey, and the Galbiga
will become a Parmesan cheese!'</p>

<p>"We shall see! We shall see!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="signature">"<i>September 21.</i></div>

<p>"Your letter has awakened in me a tumult of
feelings which cannot be described in writing.</p>

<p>"Of course my grandmother's action and the
indirect malevolence of Pasotti grieve me deeply,
but your too violent indignation is far more painful
to me. When some one holding my power-of-attorney
presents himself at Brescia, payment
cannot be refused. It is true that you, a woman,
are not expected to know these things. I can also
forgive your anger, for in the beginning I myself
was not unmoved. Then I asked myself: Why
are you indignant? Why are you surprised?
Were you not already acquainted with that evil
spirit, and have you not already suffered greater
insult from it?</p>

<p>"I am most deeply grieved that you did not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
succeed in hiding your feelings from Maria; I am
deeply moved to learn that you repented of this;
and deeply thankful that you love the Lord in
the child, and that you have confessed as much
to me. Indeed I feel I should not be so overjoyed
at this, for the heavens and the earth are always
inviting us to love God; He is visible in every ray
of light, and His voice may be heard in every
truth. But, at least, you are beginning to hear
this voice! I have never touched upon this subject
in my letters because I feel I am not capable
of speaking worthily and efficaciously of it to you.
And now I shall let God Himself speak to you
through the child, and once more resume my
silence. But remember, I am waiting in suspense;
I am hoping and praying.</p>

<p>"How can I express to you what I feel for Maria?
Who could describe this emotion, this immense
tenderness, this consuming desire to clasp her for
a moment, only for one moment, to my heart?
Do you believe I shall be able to wait until November?
No, no, no! I will write, I will copy, I
will do the work of others, but I must come to
Lugano sooner! Cover her with kisses for me, and
meanwhile, tell her that Papa carries his Maria
in his heart always, and that he sends her his
blessing. Ask her what she wishes me to bring
her and let me know, without thinking too much
about my poverty.</p>

<p>"With my whole soul I embrace you, my Luisa.</p>

<div class="signature">"<i>September 24, 1855.</i></div>

<p>"At last! Ever since you left I have been longing
for you to touch upon this question. How did I
explain myself that night, in my painful emotion?
How did you understand me, in your equally
painful emotion? For months and months I have
felt the necessity of speaking of this to you, and
I have never done so because I lacked courage.</p>

<p>"You will remember you accused me of pride
that night. I implore you to believe that I
am not proud. I cannot even understand such
an accusation.</p>

<p>"Your letter gives me the idea that you think
I have returned to a belief in God. But did I
ever tell you that I do not believe in God? I cannot
have told you so, for the whole history of my opinions
is engraved upon my mind, and the fright, the
distressing thought that I might perhaps no longer
be able to believe in God, came to me after you
left. I know the day, the very hour. At S.
Mamette I had heard them talking of a great
dinner your grandmother had given at Brescia,
while I could not even procure the food and wine
necessary for the diet the doctor&mdash;fearing the
loss of the right eye&mdash;had prescribed for our beloved
Uncle. I struggled against these awful
shadows, Franco, and I conquered. It is true the
victory is due, in a great measure, to Maria. I
mean that if all these black clouds hide the existence
of Supreme Justice from me, a ray of light
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
from it reaches me through Maria; and this ray
of light makes me believe, makes me hope in the
Orb. For it would be too horrible if the universe
were not governed by justice!</p>

<p>"That night then, I can only have told you that
I understood religion in a different way from you;
that prayers and acts of Christian faith did not
seem to me essential to the religious idea, but
rather love and actions for those who suffer,
rather indignation and actions against those who
cause suffering!</p>

<p>"And you wish to resume your silence? No, you
must not. You feel weak, you say. Do you feel
you yourself are weak, or your <i>Credo</i>? Let us
reason, let us discuss. Confess that one reason
why you who believe, love your beliefs, is because
they are comfortably restful to the intellect. You
stretch yourselves at your ease in them as in a
hammock, suspended in the air by innumerable
threads spun by men and fastened by men to
many hooks. You are comfortable, and if any
one examines or lays his hand upon one only of
these threads, you are troubled, and afraid it will
snap, because very probably its neighbour will
snap also, and after that one, another; and so,
to your great fright and pain, your fragile bed
will come tumbling down from the sky to the
earth. I know this fright and this pain, I know
that the satisfaction of walking on solid ground
must be purchased at this cost, and therefore I
am not deterred by a pity that would be false from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
discussing with you. But I may be mistaken,
and perhaps it may be you who will lift me up,
up to your resting place of fragile threads and air.
Maria is not equal to this task. If Maria makes
me believe in God, it does not follow that she can
make me believe in the Church as well. And
you yourself believe in the Church above all
things. Therefore try to convince me, and I
also will listen in suspense, and though I do not
pray, at least I can hope, because now my longing
for a perfect union with you is stronger than ever
before. Now, together with my old affection, I
feel a new admiration for you, a new gratitude
towards you.</p>

<p>"Will you take offence at this outpouring of
mine? Remember that you must have found a
letter from me in your handbag, eight months
ago, and that I have waited eight months for an
answer!</p>

<p>"The Professor and Ester now meet at our house
as fiancés. They, at least, are happy. She
goes to church and he does not, and neither of
them thinks any more about it than they do
about the difference in the colour of their hair.
And I believe nine hundred and ninety-nine
couples in a thousand do the same."</p>

<p>"I embrace you. Write me a long, long letter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
SIGNORA LUISA, COME HOME!</h2>

<p>In the early afternoon of the twenty-seventh
of September Luisa was returning from
Porlezza with some documents to copy for the
notary. In those days the rocks between S.
Michele and Porlezza were perfectly bare, and
destitute of the narrow pathway which now runs
across them. Luisa had had herself ferried that
short distance, and had then walked along the
lane that, like all those of my little world, both
ancient and modern, would admit of no other
method of travel; that pretty deceitful lane, that
seeks in every way to avoid leading whither the
traveller wishes to go. At Cressogno it passes
above Villa Maironi, which, however, is not visible
from the path.</p>

<p>"What if I should meet her?" Luisa thought,
her blood boiling. But she met no one. On the
slope between Cressogno and Campo, the sun
beat fiercely. When she reached the cool, high
valley known as Campo, she sat down in the
shade of the colossal chestnut-tree that is still
alive, the last of three or four venerable patriarchs,
and looked towards the houses of her native
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Castello, clustered in a circle round a lofty peak
among those shady crags. She thought of her
dead mother, and was glad she, at least, was at
rest. Presently she heard some one exclaim:
"Oh, blessed Madonna!" It was Signora Peppina,
who was also on her way from Cressogno, and who
was in despair because neither at S. Mamette,
Loggio, nor Cressogno had she been able to find
any eggs. "Carlo will beat me this time! He'll
kill me outright, my dear!" She would have
liked to go on to Puria, but she was half dead
with fatigue. What roads! How many stones!
"When I think of my Milan, my dear!" She sat
down on the grass beside Luisa, saying many
affectionate things to her, and wanted her to guess
with whom she had been speaking about her,
only a few minutes before. "With the Signora
Marchesa! Certainly! Yes indeed! Oh, my dear...."
It looked as if Signora Peppina
had great things to tell, but did not dare do so,
and as their presence in her throat was causing
her discomfort, she was bound to make Luisa
draw them out. "What a business!" she would
exclaim from time to time. "What a business!
What language! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" But Luisa
held her peace. At last the other yielded to the
terrible tickling in her throat, and poured forth
her story. She had gone to the Marchesa's cook
to borrow some eggs, and the Signora Marchesa,
hearing her voice, had insisted upon seeing her,
and had kept her there chattering. In her heart
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
she had felt what she believed to be a heavenly
inspiration, which prompted her to speak of that
unhappy family. Perhaps this was the right
moment! She must speak about Maria, "that
precious darling, that sweet little mouse, that dear
little creature!" But alas! The inspiration had
come from the devil and not from Heaven! She
had begun to speak, had been going to say how
lovely Maria was, how sweet, and how wonderfully
precocious, when that ugly old woman interrupted
her, looking as black as a thunder-cloud.
"Say no more about her, let her alone, Signora
Bianconi. I am aware she is very badly behaved,
and indeed one cannot expect her to be otherwise!"
Then Peppina had tried sounding another note,
and had touched upon Uncle Piero's misfortune
in having lost his eye. "The Lord chastises the
dishonest, Signora Bianconi." Here Peppina
glanced at Luisa and regretted her chattering.
She began caressing her, reproaching herself for
having spoken, and entreated her to be calm.
Luisa assured her that she was perfectly calm,
that nothing coming from that source could surprise
her. But Peppina insisted upon giving her
a kiss, and then went her way, murmuring a
string of "Oh, dear me's!" and haunted by a
vague suspicion that she had made a mess of it!</p>

<p>Luisa rose and turned to look towards Cressogno,
clenching her fists. "If I only had a horse-whip!"
she thought "If I could only lash her!"
The idea of a meeting, the old idea that had made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
her quiver with passion four years ago, on the
night of her mother's death, had flashed across
her mind shortly before, as she passed Cressogno,
and had once more taken violent possession of
her, and now made her start suddenly downwards.
She checked her steps at once, however, and
returning slowly, went towards S. Mamette,
stopping every now and then to think, her brow
clouded, her lips tightly compressed, seeking to
untangle a knot in the thread of a scheme she was
weaving in her secret heart.</p>

<p>At Casarico she sought out the Professor to
offer him an opportunity of meeting Ester at her
house the next day at two o'clock. As she was
leaving she asked him if the Maironi documents
were still in his possession. The Professor,
greatly astonished at this question, replied that
they were, expecting an explanation, but Luisa
went away without further words. She was
anxious to get home, for she could not rely either
upon Cia or Uncle Piero to look after Maria, and
she had little confidence in the girl to whom she
had given notice. She found Maria alone on the
church-place, and scolded Veronica. Then she
went to her room and began a letter to Franco.</p>

<p>She had been writing about five minutes when
she heard a gentle tap on the window of the adjoining
room. That window looked out upon a
short flight of steps, leading from the square by
the church to some stables, and thence to a short
cut to Albogasio Superiore. Luisa went into the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
little room, and saw behind the iron grating the
red and distracted countenance of Barborin Pasotti,
who motioned to her to be quiet, and asked
if she had visitors. Upon being reassured, Barborin
glanced swiftly up and down, and hastily
descending the steps entered the house in great
trepidation.</p>

<p>Poor woman, she was on forbidden ground, and
before her loomed the spectre of the wrathful
Pasotti. Pasotti was in Lugano. "Oh, Lord,
yes! In Lugano." Having imparted this information
to Luisa the unhappy woman began to
roll her eyes and squirm. Pasotti had gone to
Lugano on account of the great dinner that was to
take place on the morrow&mdash;to purchase provisions.
How? Had Luisa not heard about the dinner?
Did she not know who was coming? Why! The
Signora Marchesa! The Signora Marchesa Maironi!
Luisa started.</p>

<p>Barborin, misunderstanding the expression of
her eyes, thought she read a reproach there, and
began to cry, her face buried in her hands, shaking
those two poor black curls, and saying through
her fingers that she was so distressed about it, so
distressed! She would rather have lived on bread
and water for a year than invite the Marchesa to
dinner. This dinner was indeed a cross to her,
for it took a deal of thought, and then there was
the trouble of preparing everything, to say nothing
of Pasotti's awful scoldings, but the worst
part of it all was the idea of displeasing Luisa.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
If, at least, it had been a cross she could lay at
the feet of our Lord, but she could not do that,
for it contained too much wrath. She had come
on purpose to tell her Luisa how distressed she
was on account of this dinner.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Luisa!" she said in her hoarse
voice, that seemed to come out of an ancient and
tightly closed spinet. "I really could not prevent
it, indeed I could not, indeed I could not!"</p>

<p>They were seated side by side on the sofa.
Barborin drew a great handkerchief from her
pocket and pressed it to her face with one hand,
while with the other she sought Luisa's hand,
without turning her head. But Luisa rose, and
going to the writing-desk, scrawled upon a piece
of paper: "When is the Marchesa coming? What
road will she take?" Barborin answered that the
dinner was to be at half-past three; that at about
three the Marchesa would leave her gondola at
the landing-stage of the Calcinera, where Pasotti
was to meet her with four men and the famous
litter that had belonged to an archbishop of Milan
a century ago.</p>

<p>Luisa listened to every detail in silence and
with the greatest attention. Before leaving,
Signora Pasotti said she longed to kiss that love
of a Maria, but was afraid the child might not
know how to keep the secret. At this point the
good creature plunged her left arm into her pocket
up to the elbow, and drew out a small tin boat,
which she begged Luisa to give to her little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
daughter in the name of another battered old
craft, whose identity must not be made known.
Then she rushed down stairs and disappeared.</p>

<p>Luisa returned to her letter to Franco, but
having thought a long time, pen in hand, she
finally put the letter away again without having
added a word, and drawing the notary's documents
towards her, began to copy. Her resolution
was formed. Fate itself was offering her
this meeting with the old wretch. She had
neither a doubt nor a scruple. The passion
which had sprung up within her so long ago, which
she had caressed and fostered, had now gathered
that strength which, when it reaches its full,
transforms the thought into the deed at one blow,
and in such a manner that all responsibility seems
removed from the agent, while in reality, it is
simply carried back to the first inward movement
of yielding to temptation.</p>

<p>Yes, on the morrow, either at the landing-stage,
on the Calcinera path, or on the church-place of
the Annunciata, she would stand scornfully before
the Marchesa, openly declaring war, and
advising her to have a care, for now all legitimate
weapons of defence were to be used against her.
Yes, she would tell her so, and then she would
act, act alone and unaided, since Franco would
take no steps. If Franco had made promises she
had not. A little later she wrote a note to the
lawyer V. begging him to come to her as soon as
possible. She wished to learn from him how to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
use the documents in Gilardoni's possession.
Then she resumed her copying for the notary at
Porlezza.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The next day Professor Beniamino arrived at
Oria an hour earlier than the time fixed by Luisa.
After Ester's "yes," the man had become transfigured.
He seemed much younger than before.
The sallowness of his skin, now irradiated by a
rosy inner light, had entirely disappeared, and
was only perceptible on his bald head, where
Luisa daily expected to see the hair begin to grow.
He neither walked nor breathed as before. But
to-day he arrived with a clouded brow.</p>

<p>It was reported at S. Mamette that the physician
of Pellio had been arrested and taken to Como,
and that letters and memoranda had been found in
his possession which incriminated others, among
whom was Don Franco Maironi.</p>

<p>"I do not fear for Franco," said Luisa. "As
to the rest, my good Professor, we will set the
physician of Pellio, who is a big fellow and weighs
pounds and pounds, down in the score the
Emperor of Austria will have to pay. And
now, Professor, I want you to promise me something."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to promise?"</p>

<p>"I need those famous documents."</p>

<p>"They are at your service."</p>

<p>"Pray note that it is I and not Franco who ask
for them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
    "Yes, yes. Whatever you do is well done. I
will bring you the documents to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That is right."</p>

<p>Luisa knitted as she talked, her needles clicking
continually, but her seeming calm and good
spirits did not entirely conceal her inward excitement,
which had begun on the previous day, had
become more intense during a sleepless night, and
was now steadily increasing as the moment for
setting out drew nearer. Even in the playful
tone of her voice an unusual chord seemed to be
vibrating. About her hair, which was always
most carefully dressed, there was a something of
disorder, like the touch of a light breath brushing
gently across her brow.</p>

<p>Ester arrived at a quarter to two, and explained
that she had come a little earlier because she had
heard it thunder. Thunder? Luisa hastened to
the terrace to examine the sky. It certainly did
not look very threatening. Above the point of
Cressogno and over Galbiga the sky was perfectly
serene as far as the hills of the Lake of Como.
Towards Carona it was indeed rather dark,
but not so very dark, after all. What if the
Marchesa should not come on account of the
weather? She seized the little telescope that was
kept in the loggia. There was nothing to be
seen. Of course; it was still too early. In order
to reach the Calcinera at three, the Marchesa,
with that heavy gondola of hers, must start at
about half-past two. Luisa went back to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
hall, where she found Ester, the Professor, and
Maria. She would have preferred to have Maria
remain in the loggia with Uncle Piero, but Signorina
Missipipì always clung fast to her mother
when there were visitors, becoming all eyes and
ears. Luisa decided that when she was ready to
start she would send Maria away, meanwhile she
would keep her with her. As to the happy couple,
they were seated apart, and were conversing
almost in whispers.</p>

<p>Luisa, who now found it difficult to keep quiet,
once more returned to the terrace, and looked
through the telescope. Her heart gave a bound!
The gondola was just coming in sight at the
Tentiòn.</p>

<p>It was a quarter-past two o'clock.</p>

<p>Some one coming from Albogasio had stopped
in the church-place to speak to some one coming
down the steps at the side of Casa Ribera. They
were saying: "Signor Pasotti has just gone down
with the litter. There was a troop of children
following."</p>

<p>Now the sky was overcast, even above the
point of Cressogno and the Galbiga. Only the
hills of the Lake of Como were still in the sunshine.
The terrible wind which accompanies a thunderstorm,
and which in Valsolda is called the <i>Caronasco</i>,
was threatening seriously now. Above
Corona the colour of the clouds was gradually
becoming one with the colour of the hills. The
great cloud over Zocca d'i Ment had become dark
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
blue, and the Boglia was also beginning to knit
its brows. The lake was calm and leaden.</p>

<p>Luisa had decided to start when the gondola
should have arrived opposite S. Mamette. She
now returned to the hall.</p>

<p>Maria had obeyed her mother's orders, and had
not moved from the chair where Luisa had left
her, but noticing that the Professor was speaking
with animation and at great length to Ester, she
had asked:</p>

<p>"Are you telling her a story?"</p>

<p>At this point Luisa entered.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said Ester, laughing. "He is
telling me a story."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell it to me also! To me also!"</p>

<p>A muffled peal of thunder resounded. "Go,
Maria dear," said Ester. "Go to your room and
pray the Lord not to send a terrible thunderstorm
or hail."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes! I will pray to the Lord!"</p>

<p>The little one went out, and entered the alcove-room,
serious and dignified, as if in that moment
the safety of the whole Valsolda depended upon
her prayer. Prayer to her was always a solemn
matter; it was a point of contact with mystery
which always made her assume a grave and attentive
air, as did also certain tales of enchantment
and magic. She mounted a chair and said the
few prayers she knew, and then assumed the
attitude she had seen the most pious women of
town assume in church, and began moving her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
lips as they did, repeating a wordless prayer.
Seeing her thus one acquainted with the terrible
secret of the next hour would have felt that the
guardian angel of little children was standing beside
her at that moment, and admonishing her to
pray for something besides the vineyards and olive-groves
of Valsolda, for something nearer to her,
something the angel did not name, and she
neither knew nor could put into words. The
onlooker would have felt also that in these,
her inarticulate whisperings, there was an element
of occult tenderness, and tragedy, the
docile surrender of a sweet soul to the admonitions
of its guardian angel, to the mysterious will
of God.</p>

<p>At half-past two the great lowering clouds
above Carona belched forth another peal of
thunder, to which the other great clouds above
Boglia and the Zocca d'i Ment immediately responded.
Luisa ran out to the terrace. The
gondola was opposite S. Mamette, and was making
straight for the Calcinera. She could see quite
plainly that the boatmen were pulling hard. As
Luisa laid aside the telescope the first gust of wind
swept through the loggia, banging doors and
windows. Terrified by a feeling that she would
be too late, she hastily closed both doors and
windows, passed swiftly through the hall, seized
an umbrella and went out, without telling any one
she was going, and without closing the house-door
behind her. She started towards Albogasio
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Inferiore. Just beyond the cemetery, on
the spot they call Mainè, she met Ismaele.</p>

<p>"Where are you going in such weather, Signora
Luisa?"</p>

<p>She answered that she was going to Albogasio,
and passed on. When she had gone about a
hundred paces she remembered that she had not
let Veronica know she was going out, that she had
not told her to close the windows in the bedrooms,
and look after Maria. She might send word by
Ismaele. But he had already disappeared round
the corner of the cemetery. In her heart she felt
an impulse to go back, but there was not time.
The rumbling of the thunder was continuous;
great, infrequent drops were striking here and
there on the maize; gusts of wind swept at intervals
through the mulberry-trees, forerunners
of the whirlwind of the <i>Caronasco</i>. Luisa opened
her umbrella and hastened forward.</p>

<p>A furious downpour overtook her in the dark
lanes of Albogasio. But she never thought of
taking refuge in a doorway, and pushed on undaunted.
She met a troop of children who were
running away from the rain, after waiting in
vain on the church-place of the Annunciata for the
passing of the Marchesa in the litter. While she
was crossing the short space between the town-hall
of Albogasio and the church, the wind turned her
umbrella inside out. She began to run, and
reached the strip of ground behind the church
that overlooks the path leading down to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Calcinera. There, protected by the church from
the driving rain, she righted her umbrella as
best she could, and looked over the parapet.</p>

<p>The Annunciata rests upon the summit of a
cliff, sparsely covered with brambles and wild
fig-trees, which rises from the foot of the Boglia
and juts out over the lake, shutting in the narrow
path to Calcinera on the west. The strip of
ground where Luisa stood runs along that part of
the cliff's brow. From here she could have followed
the course of the boat from the waters of
Cressogno as far as the landing-stage, but now
that the rain was pouring down in sheets, a white
mist hid all things from view. However, unless
the Marchesa returned to Cressogno, she must
certainly pass that way, no matter where she
landed, for there, at the foot of the cliff, where it
juts out with the coast, the narrow stairway
starts upwards, leading from the Calcinera to the
church-place, and this is the only way of reaching
Albogasio Superiore either from the landing-stage
below, or from S. Mamette, Casarico, or Cadate.</p>

<p>Presently the violence of the downpour lessened,
the dark phantoms of the mountains began to
stand out against the white background. Luisa
gazed down at the lake. There was no gondola
on the lake, and no litter on the path; nothing
was to be seen. This troubled her. Was it
possible that the gondola had returned to Cressogno?
The mist cleared rapidly, and Cadate
became discernible, while at the door of the boathouse
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
of the "Palazz" the prow of the gondola
appeared, shimmering white in the thin, grey
mist. Ah, the Marchesa had taken refuge at the
"Palazz," and Pasotti with his bearers had done
the same. The thunderstorm was now practically
over and the litter would soon appear.</p>

<p>But instead, ten long minutes elapsed. Luisa
kept her eyes fixed on the point where the path
from Cadate turns into the Calcinera. No movement
of thought was going on within her. Her
whole soul was watching and waiting, that was all.
People passed her on the left going up to Albogasio
or coming down, but each time she inclined
her umbrella so that she was hidden from view,
so that they might not recognise her, thus avoiding
greetings and conversations.</p>

<p>At last a group of people appeared at the bend
of the path. Luisa could distinguish the litter,
and behind the litter Pasotti and Don Giuseppe,
and the Marchesa's boatmen bringing up the rear.
Still she did not move, but followed the litter with
her eyes as it slowly advanced. Presently she
closed her umbrella, for the rain had almost
ceased. Five or six children from Albogasio
reappeared. She ordered them off sharply. They
hesitated to obey, but a sudden downpour of rain,
unaccompanied by wind or thunder, put them to
flight. The litter had now reached the foot of
the steps. Luisa moved forward.</p>

<p>Her eyes glittered coldly, and she held herself
very erect. Absorbed in one thought, she heeded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
not at all the pelting rain, which beat upon her
head and shoulders, which surrounded her with a
misty veil and loud noise. Perhaps she was glad
of this outburst of passion in the elements, which
was in keeping with the passion within her. She
went slowly down, clasping the handle of her
closed umbrella very tightly, as if it had been the
handle of a weapon. There is a somewhat sharp
bend in the stairway, and the bottom is not visible
until this bend is reached. Upon arriving there
she saw the litter had stopped. The two boatmen
were taking the places of two of the bearers.</p>

<p>Luisa went down as far as the spot where a
great walnut-tree spreads its branches above the
stairs. Here she stopped just as the Marchesa's
bearers began coming upwards. Everything was
as Luisa wished. Pasotti and Don Giuseppe,
bringing up the rear with open umbrellas, could
not see her. The bearers, on reaching the spot
where she stood, would be obliged to stop to let
her pass.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer she recognised the two who
carried the front of the litter; one was Ismaele's
brother, the other a cousin of Veronica's. When
they were within a yard or two of her she ordered
them, by an imperious gesture, to stop. They
obeyed at once, and set the litter down, the two
other bearers doing the same without knowing
why. Pasotti raised his umbrella, and seeing
Luisa, made a movement of astonishment, frowning
blackly. Seizing Don Giuseppe, he drew him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
aside that she might pass, never dreaming that
the meeting was intentional.</p>

<p>But Luisa did not move. "You did not think
of meeting me, did you, Signor Pasotti?" she said
in a loud voice. The Marchesa stuck her head
out, caught sight of her, and withdrew it again,
saying, with new strength in her usually lifeless
voice:</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>At that moment loud cries rang out from the
top of the church-place above them. "<i>Sciora</i>
Luisa! <i>Sciora</i> Luisa!" Luisa did not hear. Pasotti
had called angrily to the bearers: "Go on!" and
they had resumed the poles.</p>

<p>"Go on if you like," said she, resolved to walk
along beside the litter. "I have only a few words
to say."</p>

<p>If Pasotti and the old Marchesa had anticipated
tears and supplications this fierce glance and
ringing voice must now have led them to expect
something quite different.</p>

<p>"Words at present?" said Pasotti, coming forward
almost threateningly.</p>

<p>"<i>Sciora</i> Luisa! <i>Sciora</i> Luisa!" a voice cried
close at hand in a tone of anguish, while with the
cries was mingled the noise of hastening steps.
But Luisa did not appear to hear anything. "Yes,
at present!" she said, addressing Pasotti with
indescribable haughtiness. "I am generous
enough to wish to warn this lady that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Sciora</i> Luisa!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
    This time she was forced to pause and look
round. Three or four women were upon her,
distraught, dishevelled, sobbing: "Come home
at once! Come home at once!" These faces, these
tears, these voices, detached her from her passion,
from her purpose, at one blow.</p>

<p>She rushed in among the women, exclaiming:
"What is the matter?" and they could only repeat,
their eyes starting from their heads: "Come
home, come home at once!"</p>

<p>"But what has happened, you stupid things?"</p>

<p>"The child, the child!"</p>

<p>"Maria? Maria? What is it, what is it?" she
shrieked like a mad woman. Amidst their sobbing
she caught the word <i>lake</i>, and uttering a great
cry, she dashed them out of her path like a wild
beast, and rushed up the stairs. The women
could not keep up with her, but on the church-place
there were others waiting in spite of the rain,
and they were also crying and sobbing.</p>

<p>Luisa felt herself growing faint, and fell to the
ground on reaching the last step.</p>

<p>The women ran to her, many hands seized her
and lifted her up. She shrieked: "Good God!
Is she dead?" Some one answered: "No, no!"
"The doctor?" she gasped. "The doctor?"
Many voices answered that he was already
there.</p>

<p>Once more she appeared to regain all her energy,
and sprang eagerly forward. Eight or ten people
hastened after her, but only two could keep up
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
with her. She flew! At the cemetery she met
Ismaele and another man, and cried out as soon
as she caught sight of them:</p>

<p>"Is she still alive? Is she alive?" Ismaele's
companion turned and ran back to tell them that
the mother was coming, but Ismaele was weeping,
and could only answer: "Good God! <i>Sciora</i>
Luisa!" as he tried to detain her. Luisa pushed
him wildly aside and rushed on, followed by the
boatman who had now quite lost his head and
was calling out to her as she ran: "Perhaps it is
nothing! Perhaps it is nothing, after all!" But
the pelting, ceaseless, even downpour, seemed to
be contradicting his words with its wail.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, she reached the square by
the church of Oria, and had the strength to call
out: "Maria! My Maria!" The window of the
alcove-room was open. She heard Cia crying
and Ester chiding her. Several people, among
them Professor Gilardoni, came out to meet her.
The Professor, as pale as a ghost, was weeping
silently with clasped hands. The others whispered:
"Courage, there is still hope!" In her
exhaustion she came near falling. The Professor
encircled her waist with one arm and drew her up
the stairs, which were crowded with people, as was
also the corridor of the first floor.</p>

<p>As Luisa passed, the Professor almost carrying
her, voices laden with words of comfort murmured:
"Courage! Courage! Who can tell?
Who can tell?" At the door of the alcove-room
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
she freed herself from the Professor's arm, and
went in alone.</p>

<p>They had been obliged to light a lamp, because
it was already dark in the alcove, owing to the
rain. Poor, sweet little Maria lay naked upon
the bed, her eyes half open, and her lips slightly
parted. Her face was still tinged with pink, but
her lips were discoloured and her body was deathly
pale. The doctor, with Ester's help, was trying
to induce artificial breathing, alternately raising
the tiny arms above the head and stretching them
along the sides, and compressing the abdomen.</p>

<p>"Doctor! Doctor!" Luisa sobbed.</p>

<p>"We're doing all we can," the doctor answered
gravely. She flung herself face downwards upon
her baby's little icy feet, and covered them with
wild kisses. Ester began to tremble. "No, no!"
the doctor exclaimed. "Courage! Courage!"
"Help!" shrieked Luisa. The doctor checked
her by a gesture, and motioned to Ester to pause
in her work. He bent over Maria's little face,
placed his mouth upon hers and having breathed
deeply several times, raised his head again. "But
she is still rosy, she is still rosy!" Luisa gasped
softly. The doctor sighed gently, struck a match
and held it close to Maria's lips.</p>

<p>Three or four women who were praying on their
knees, rose and approached the bed, holding their
breath in suspense. The door leading into the
hall was open, and other faces appeared there,
all silent and intent. Luisa, kneeling beside the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
bed, kept her eyes fixed on the flame. A voice
murmured:</p>

<p>"It quivers!"</p>

<p>Ester, standing very erect behind Luisa, shook
her head. The doctor put out the match. "Hot
flannels," he ordered. Luisa rushed from the
room, and the doctor once more resumed the
movements of the arms. When Luisa returned
with the hot flannels they began to rub the child's
chest and bowels, he on one side, she on the other.
Presently, noting Luisa's pallor, and the distortion
of her features, he motioned to a girl to
take her place. "You must give up," said he,
for Luisa had made a protesting gesture. "Even
I am tired. You cannot go on." Luisa shook
her head without speaking and continued her
work with convulsive energy. The doctor silently
shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows,
and gave his place to the girl, ordering Ester to
bring more flannel with which to cover the child's
legs. Ester went out and herself heated the
flannel, for Veronica, on hearing what had happened,
had disappeared and was nowhere to be
found. In the corridor and on the stairs people
were discussing the how and where of the event,
and as Ester passed all inquired: "What news?
What news?" Ester made a despairing gesture
and went on without answering. Then the talk
once more flowed on in an undertone.</p>

<p>No one knew how long the child had been in the
water. While the thunderstorm had been raging
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
a certain Toni Gall had happened to be in the
stables behind Casa Ribera. Reflecting that if
the engineer's boat was not tied fast enough it
would be dashed to pieces against the walls of the
boathouse, he bounded down the steps, and seeing
the door open, went in. The boat was being
frightfully knocked about, and was drenched with
the splashing of the waves that broke against the
walls. It was tossing and writhing among its
chains, and had set itself crosswise, with the stern
knocking against the wall. Opposite the door
that opens from the road, there runs a gallery
from which two flights of steps lead down to the
water, the first on the side of the prow, the second
on the side of the stern. Toni Gall went down the
second flight to tighten the stern chain. There,
between the boat and the lowest step, where the
water is from sixty to seventy centimetres deep, he
saw Maria's little body. She was floating face
downwards, with her back above the water. As he
drew her out he saw a little tin boat lying on the
bottom. He carried the child to the house, crying
out with his terrible voice, bringing the whole
town to the spot, and fortunately the doctor also,
who happened to be in Oria, and then he helped
Ester undress the poor little creature, who gave
no sign of life.</p>

<p>With whom had she been before going down to
the lake? Not with Veronica, for before Luisa
went out Veronica had been seen going into the
storeroom where the flowerpots were kept, with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
her customs-guard. Nor had she been with Ester
and the Professor. Ester had sent her to pray
in the alcove-room, and had not seen her again.
Cia had been sewing and Uncle Piero had been
writing when they heard Toni Gall's shouts.
Maria must have gone straight from the alcove-room
to the boathouse to sail her boat, and as ill-luck
would have it, she had found both the house
door and the door of the boathouse open. It
was Toni Gall's opinion that she had been in the
water several minutes, for she was floating at
some distance from the spot where the little tin
boat lay. Standing in the hall where Cia, the
engineer, the Professor, and others from the village
were assembled, he was describing his frightful
discovery for the hundredth time. All save
Uncle Piero were sobbing. Seated on the sofa
where Ester and the Professor had sat, he seemed
turned to stone. He shed no tears and spoke
never a word. Toni Gall's chattering was evidently
annoying to him, but he held his peace.
His noble countenance was rather solemn and
grave than distressed. It was as if the shade of
ancient Destiny had arisen before his eyes. He
did not even ask for news; it was evident he was
without hope. And it was also evident that his
sorrow was very different from all this nervous,
noisy, fleeting sorrow that surrounded him. His
was the mute, calm grief of the wise and the
strong.</p>

<p>From the open door of the alcove-room came
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
voices now commanding, now questioning, but
for an hour and a half no one could have asserted
that they had heard Luisa's voice. From time
to time half-frightened, almost happy exclamations
were heard. Some one in there had thought they
perceived a movement, a breath, the glow of life.
Then all who were outside would press forward.
Uncle Piero would turn his face towards the door,
and only at such moments would his expression
become slightly troubled. Alas! Each time he
saw the others turn slowly away, in heartbroken
silence. It was past five o'clock now, and as it
continued to rain the light had begun to fade.</p>

<p>Finally, at half-past five, Luisa's voice was
heard. She gave a loud and terrible cry, which
froze the blood in the veins of all. The doctor's
voice answered in accents of eager protest. It
was whispered that he had made a gesture which
said plainly: "It is hopeless now, let us desist," but
at her cry he had once more renewed his efforts.</p>

<p>The monotonous lament that the fine rain
sent in through all the open windows made the
stillness of the house seem more sepulchral than
ever. The hall and the corridor were growing
dark, and the pale candle-light from the alcove-room
seemed brilliant by contrast. People began
to go away silently and on tiptoe, one shadow
after another, and presently steps and hushed
voices and the beat of heavy boots were heard
on the pavement of the street below. Cia went
softly towards her master, and asked him in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
whisper if he would not eat something. He
silenced her by an imperious gesture.</p>

<p>After seven o'clock, when all outsiders had
left save Toni Gall, Ismaele, the Professor, Ester,
and three or four women who were in the alcove-room,
long, low groans, which seemed hardly
human, broke the silence. The doctor came into
the hall. It was now quite dark, and he knocked
against a chair. "Is the engineer here?" he asked
aloud. "Yes, sir," Toni Gall replied, and went
for a candle. The engineer neither spoke nor
moved.</p>

<p>Toni Gall soon returned with a candle and Dr.
Aliprandi&mdash;whom I am happy to recall here as a
frank and upright man, possessed of a fine intellect
and a noble heart&mdash;approached the sofa where
Uncle Piero sat.</p>

<p>"Engineer Ribera," said he with tears in his
eyes, "it is time for you to do something now."</p>

<p>"For me to do something?" said Uncle Piero,
raising his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes. We must at least try to get her away.
You must come and speak a word. You are like
a father to her. At such moments as these it is
a father's place to speak."</p>

<p>"Let my master alone," Cia grumbled. "He
can't do these things. It would just be making
him miserable to no purpose."</p>

<p>Now pitying voices and kisses mingled with
the groans.</p>

<p>The engineer pressed his clenched fists upon the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
sofa, and remained motionless for a moment,
with bowed head. Then he rose, not without
difficulty, and said to the doctor:</p>

<p>"Must I go alone?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to be present?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well. Our efforts may be of no avail.
I should not wish to force her, but we must, at
least, make an attempt."</p>

<p>The doctor dismissed the women who were
still in the alcove-room; then, standing in the
doorway, he turned to the engineer and motioned
to him to come in.</p>

<p>"Donna Luisa," said he gently, "here is your
uncle, who is coming to beseech you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The old man staggered as he came forward,
although his face was composed. He advanced
a few steps and then stopped. Luisa was seated
upon the bed with her dead baby in her arms,
holding her tight, kissing her face and neck, and
uttering long, heart-rending groans as she pressed
her lips to the little body.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," she was saying, with almost
a smile of tenderness in her voice. "It is your
uncle, dear, your uncle, who is coming to see his
little treasure, his little Maria, his little Missipipì,
who loves him so much! Yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"Luisa," said Uncle Piero, "you must control
yourself. Everything that could be done has
been done. Now come with me&mdash;don't remain
here any longer&mdash;come with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
    "Uncle, Uncle!" cried Luisa, in a voice full of
tenderness but without looking towards him,
while she pressed the little dead body to her
breast and rocked backwards and forwards.
"Come here! Come here to your Maria! Come!
Come to us, for you are our uncle, our dear uncle!
No, dear, no, dear! Our uncle will not forsake us."</p>

<p>Uncle Piero shuddered. His grief overwhelmed
him for a moment, and wrenched a sob from him.</p>

<p>"Let her rest!" he murmured in a stifled voice.
She did not appear to hear him, and continued:
"We will go to our uncle, dear, you and I. Do
you want to go to him, Maria? Yes, yes! Let us
go!" She slid from the bed to the floor and went to
Uncle Piero. Clutching her sweet, dead burden
to her breast with one arm, she threw the other
about the old man's neck, and whispered: "A
kiss, a kiss, for your little Missipipì. One kiss,
only one!"</p>

<p>Uncle Piero bent down and kissed the little
face, already sadly ravaged by death, wetting it
with two great tears.</p>

<p>"Look, look, Uncle!" she said. "Doctor,
bring the candle! Yes, yes! Don't be cruel,
doctor. Look, Uncle! See what a little treasure
she is, doctor!"</p>

<p>Aliprandi hesitated, and tried to resist her
appeals, but in this mad grief there was something
sacred, something that must be respected. He
obeyed, and raising the candle, held it close to the
tiny corpse, that was intensely pitiful with its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
half-open eyes and dilated pupils, this little corpse
that had once been Maria, sweet little Missipipì,
the old man's delight, the smile and the love of
the house.</p>

<p>"Look at this tiny breast, Uncle. See how we
have abused it, poor treasure, how we have hurt
it with all our rubbing. It was your mamma,
Maria darling! Your horrid mamma, and that
wicked doctor there."</p>

<p>"Enough!" said the doctor resolutely, setting
the candle on the writing-desk. "Talk to your
child if you will, but not to this one. Talk to the
one in Heaven."</p>

<p>The effect of his words was terrible. All tenderness
vanished from Luisa's face. She drew
back, frowning fiercely, and pressing her dead
child closer to her breast. "No!" she cried aloud.
"No, not in Heaven! She is mine! She is mine!
God is wicked! I will not give her to Him!"</p>

<p>She drew ever farther back, back into the alcove,
where, standing between the great bed and
the little one, she once more began uttering those
low groans which did not seem human. Aliprandi
sent the trembling old man out of the
room. "It will pass! It will pass!" he said. "We
must have patience. I will stay with her now."
Ismaele came into the hall and drew the Professor
aside.</p>

<p>"Has Signor Don Franco been informed?"
he asked.</p>

<p>They consulted the uncle and it was decided that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
a telegram in Uncle Piero's name, and announcing
serious illness, should be sent from Lugano the
next morning, for it was now too late. There
was some one else in the hall. Poor Barborin
Pasotti, who had hastened thither while her husband
was absent escorting the Marchesa back to
Cressogno. She was sobbing, and in despair
because she had given Maria the little boat.
She wished to go to Luisa, but the doctor, hearing
loud crying, came out and begged her to be calm
and silent. Barborin went to cry in the loggia.
The Curate, Don Brazzova, and the Prefect of the
Caravina, who had been dining at Casa Pasotti, had
accompanied Barborin. Later the Curate of
Castello, Intrioni, arrived, weeping like a child.
He was determined to go to Luisa in spite of the
doctor's protests, and knelt in the centre of the
room, entreating her to give her baby to the Lord.
"Listen, Signora Luisa, listen. If you will not
give her to God, give her to her grandmother
Teresa, to your own dear mother who will be so
happy to have her with her in Heaven."</p>

<p>Luisa was touched, not by his words, but by
his grief, and answered gently: "Can you not
understand that I do not believe in your Heaven?
My Heaven is here!"</p>

<p>Aliprandi made a gesture of entreaty to the
Curate, who went out, sobbing.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The doctor left Oria towards midnight with
the Professor. The whole house was quiet, nor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
was any voice to be heard in the alcove-room.
Aliprandi had spent the last two hours in the hall
with the Professor and Ester, and not a single
cry, not a groan, nor any movement had he
heard. He had gone twice to look in. Luisa
was sitting on the edge of her bed, her elbows on
her knees and her face in her hands, contemplating
the little bed which Aliprandi could not see.
This state of immobility caused him more anxiety
than the state of intense excitement that had
preceded it. As Ester was going to remain all
night he advised her to try and rouse her friend, to
make her talk and weep.</p>

<p>Some women from the village were to watch
with Ester, and Ismaele would be there until five
o'clock, when he must start for Lugano. Uncle
Piero had gone to bed.</p>

<p>Aliprandi and the Professor stopped on the
square by the church to look at the lighted window
of the alcove-room, and to listen. Silence.
"Accursed lake!" the physician exclaimed, taking
his companion's arm and once more starting forward.
He was certainly thinking of the sweet
little creature the lake had killed when he uttered
the words, but in his heart there was also a great
fear that other troubles might be approaching,
that the treacherous waters had not yet done
their worst; and he was overwhelmed with pity
for the poor father, who, as yet, knew nothing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
SHADOWS AND DAWN</h2>

<p>On receiving the telegram Franco at once
hastened to the office of the <i>Opinione</i>, in
Via della Rocca. Perceiving his agitation, Dina
said: "Ah! then you already know?" Franco's
blood ran cold, but on hearing about the telegram
Dina exhibited great surprise. No, no, of that he
knew nothing. Information had reached him
from the Prime Minister that the Austrian police
had been searching houses and making arrests in
Vall' Intelvi, and that among the papers of a
certain doctor there was one in which the name
of Don Franco Maironi was mentioned, with particulars
of a compromising nature. Dina added
that at a moment of such great anguish for a
father, he would refrain from going into an explanation
of Count Cavour's interest in him; suffice
it to say that he himself had mentioned Franco to
the Count, who had expressed his regret that a
Lombard gentleman, bearing such a distinguished
name, should be obliged to live in such straitened
and obscure circumstances in Turin. Dina
believed it was his intention to offer him a position
in the Foreign Office. Now, of course, Franco
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
must go. But the little girl would recover and
he must return as soon as possible. Meanwhile
he would stop at Lugano, would he not?
He must, at least, await news there, and unless it
became absolutely necessary, he must not venture
into Lombardy. After this affair at Vall' Intelvi
it would be extremely imprudent. As Franco
remained silent, the director once more broached
the subject before bidding him good-bye. "Be
prudent! Don't let them take you!" But Franco
would not answer.</p>

<p>Ever since the receipt of the telegram Franco
had walked the streets of Turin like one in a dream,
deaf to the noise of his own footsteps, unconscious
of what he saw, of what he heard, going
mechanically wherever it was necessary for him
to go at this juncture, wherever a certain servile
and lower faculty of the soul might lead him, that
faculty composed of reason and of instinct, which
is capable of guiding us through a labyrinth of
city streets, while the mind, concentrated upon
some problem, some passion, takes no heed of our
movements. He sold his watch and chain to a
watchmaker of Doragrossa for one hundred and
thirty-five lire, purchased a doll for Maria,
stopped at Café Alfieri and Café Florio to leave
word for his friends, and was at the station by
eleven o'clock, although the train for Novara
which he was to take did not start until half-past
eleven. At a quarter-past the Paduan and the
young man from Udine appeared. They endeavoured
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
to encourage him with all sorts of rosy
suppositions and unconvincing arguments, but
he answered never a word and only longed intensely
for the moment of departure, longed to be alone,
to be hastening towards Oria, for he was determined
to go to Oria, no matter how great the
danger might be. He entered a third-class
carriage, and when the locomotive whistled and
the train began to move, he heaved a great sigh
of relief, and gave himself up entirely to thoughts
of Maria. But there were too many people about
him, they were too many, too rough, and too noisy.
At Chivasso, feeling he could no longer bear their
chattering and laughter, he changed into an empty
second-class carriage, where he began to talk
aloud, his eyes fixed on the opposite seat.</p>

<p>Good God! why had they not added another
word to the telegram? Just one word more!
At least the name of the illness.</p>

<p>A terrible name flashed across his brain: Croup!
He gasped with horror, and threw out his arms
against this phantom, his muscles suddenly
stiffening, then, letting his arms sink once more,
he heaved a sigh so deep that it seemed to expel
the very soul, even life itself, from his breast.
It must indeed be a sudden illness, or Luisa would
have written. Another name flashed across his
mind. Brain-fever! He himself had been at the
point of death with brain-fever when a child. Oh
God! oh God! It must be that! God Himself had
sent this thought to him. He was shaken by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
tearless sobbing. Maria, his treasure, his love,
his joy! Yes, indeed it must be that. He could
see her gasping, flushed, watched over by her
mother and the doctor. In a moment he pictured
to himself long hours spent by her bedside, long
hours of anguish, then he pictured the birth of
hope, heard the first whisper of that sweet voice:</p>

<p>"Papa! my papa!"</p>

<p>He started to his feet, clasping and wringing his
hands in a mute impulse of prayer. Presently
he sank back into his seat again, exhausted, and
turned unseeing eyes upon the flying landscape,
vaguely conscious of some connection between
the misty Alps looming motionless there against
the northern horizon and the thought that dominated
him, looming motionless and torpid within
his soul. From time to time the jolting of the
train would rouse him from his stupor, suggesting
the idea of a painful race, stimulating his
heart to rush, to beat thus also. Sometimes he
would close his eyes, the better to picture his
arrival at home. Images would at once rise from
his heart to his eyelids, but they were always
changing, continually moving, and he could not
hold them for more than a second. Now it was
Luisa hastening towards him on the stairs; now
the uncle holding out his arms to him from the
door of the hall; now Dr. Aliprandi who was
opening the door of the alcove-room to him, and
saying: "She is better, she is better!" Now in
the darkened room, filled with shadows, it was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
Maria herself who gazed at him with glassy,
feverish eyes.</p>

<p>When he reached Vercelli, he felt as if he were
a thousand miles from Turin, and once more awoke
to a sense of reality. How should he get from
Lugano to Oria? What route should he take?
Should he go openly by the lake, showing himself
at the Custom-House? And what if they would not
allow him to proceed because his passport had not
been stamped on leaving Italy as the law demanded?
Or, worse still, what if a warrant of
arrest be out against him on account of those
papers taken from the doctor at Pellio? He had
better keep to the hills. They might arrest him
later, but with his knowledge of the neighbourhood,
acquired on his many hunting expeditions
in 1848, he was almost sure of reaching home.
This wearisome task of planning and arranging
absorbed his attention for some time, and kept
him occupied until he had passed Arona, on the
Lake Maggiore steamer. He had arranged to
reach Lugano in the middle of the night. Would
there be some one there to meet him? If there
were no one there, perhaps he might hear something
at the Fontana pharmacy, where the Valsolda
people were in the habit of congregating.
If God would only permit reassuring news to
reach him at Lugano he would postpone decision
as to his journey to Oria until the morrow. He
therefore determined to make no plans before
reaching Lugano, and he prayed fervently that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
the Almighty would allow this good news to
reach him. The sky was overcast; the mountains
had already assumed their sad autumnal
tints; a thin mist hung over the lake; the bells of
Meina were ringing; on the steamer there were
but few passengers, and Franco's prayer died in
his heart, stifled by a crushing sadness, while his
eyes unconsciously followed a flock of white gulls,
that were winging their flight towards the distant
waters of Laveno, towards that hidden country
where his soul was.</p>

<p>It was past seven when he reached Magadino.
He climbed Monte Ceneri on foot, following the
path that leads to the road-mender's house, took
a carriage at Bironico and reached Lugano shortly
after midnight. He alighted in the Piazza, near
Café Terreni. The coffee-house was closed, the
square was deserted and dark, and silence reigned;
even the lake, which could be seen gently rising
and falling in the gloom, was silent. Franco
paused a moment on the shore, hoping that some
one had come to meet him, and would presently
appear. He could not see Valsolda, hidden behind
Monte Brè, but that same water mirrored
Oria, and slept in the boathouse at home. A
wave of peace eased his heart somewhat; he felt
he was among things familiar to him. Every
human voice was hushed, but the great, dark
hills spoke to him, Monte Caprino and the Zocca
d'i Ment more than all, for they overlooked Oria.
They spoke gently to him, suggesting comfort-bringing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
thoughts. Nineteen hours had passed
since the telegram was sent. All danger might
now be over.</p>

<p>As no one appeared he went to the Fontana
pharmacy, and rang the bell. For many years
he had known that most worthy, cordial, and
honest man, Signor Carlo Fontana, who has now
passed away with the world of long ago. Signor
Carlo came to the window, and was greatly surprised
to see Don Franco. He had no news from
Oria. He had spent the last two days at Tesserete,
and had returned only a few hours before, so could
tell him nothing. His assistant had started for
Bellinzona that evening. Franco thanked him
and walked away in the direction of Villa Ciani,
for he was now determined to go to Oria at once.</p>

<p>Two routes were open to him. He could either
climb the Swiss slope of the Boglia from Pregassona,
strike the heights of Bolla; cross the
Pian Biscagno and the great beech wood, coming
out at the venerable beech-tree of the Madonnina
on the brow of the hill which slopes down into
Lombardy, and then drop down on to Albogasio
Superiore and Oria; or he could take the easy
Gandria road, leading towards the lake, and then
follow that treacherous and dangerous path which
starts from Gandria, the last Swiss village, cuts
along the face of the almost perpendicular cliff,
crosses the frontier some hundred metres above
the lake, runs on to the Origa farm, drops into the
ravine of Val Malghera, rising once more to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
Rooch farm, where it joins the paved way which
passes above Niscicoree and finally leads down to
Oria. The first route was much longer and far
more difficult, but it afforded a better chance of
eluding the vigilance of the guards at the frontier.
On leaving the Fontana pharmacy Franco had
been fully determined to go that way, but when,
on reaching Cassarago, where the roads to Pregassona
and to Gandria meet, he saw how near
the point of Castagnola was, and reflected that
it would take him less than half an hour to go
from Castagnola to Gandria, and that another
hour and a half would take him from Gandria to
Oria, the idea of climbing the Boglia, of walking
seven or eight hours, became intolerable to him.
Besides, if he went by the Boglia he would arrive
in the daytime, and this, of course, would jeopardise
his safety. He turned his face resolutely
towards Castagnola and Gandria. The sky was
now completely overcast with heavy clouds.
Beneath the great chestnut trees that line the
road to Castagnola, he could not see where to set
his feet, but how much worse it would have been
in the great beech forest of the Boglia if Franco
had chosen that route. It was just as dark in
Castagnola, and worse in the labyrinth of narrow
lanes at Gandria. After wandering backwards
and forwards among these lanes for some time,
always mistaking his way, Franco at last found
himself on the path leading to the frontier, and
stopped to rest. Before starting forward again
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
in the impenetrable darkness, before braving the
dangers of a difficult path, and of a meeting with
the Austrian guards, and then facing another
terrifying step, that of entering his house, of putting
the first question, of listening to the first
answer, he raised his heart to God, and concentrated
all the powers of his mind upon a determination
to be strong and calm.</p>

<p>Once more he started forward. Now he must
give his whole attention to the path, in order not
to fall or lose his way. The little fields of Gandria
soon come to an end. Then wild tracts follow,
that jut out over the lake, and are covered with
a thick growth of low bushes; then come ravines
with crumbling sides, that go tumbling straight
downwards, and are half hidden by the bushes.
In such places as these Franco was obliged to feel
his way blindly, to cling first to one branch, then
to another, plunging his face in among the leaves,
that, at least, smelt of Valsolda, and dragging himself
from bush to bush. He must explore the
ground with his foot, trembling lest it give way
beneath him, and seeking for traces of the path.
The bundle he carried was small, but nevertheless
it embarrassed him. The rustling of the foliage
as he brushed past, irritated him; it seemed as
if it must be heard a long way off, on the hills and
on the lake, in the solemn hush of the night.
Then he would stop and listen. He could hear
only the distant thundering of the falls at Rescia,
the hooting of owls in the woods over yonder,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
across the lake, and from time to time, far below,
a sharp stroke on the water, for which he could
not account. It took him quite an hour to reach
the frontier. There, between the Valle del Confine
and the Val Malghera, the forest had been recently
cut down, and the rocky slope was bare. This
enhanced both the danger of falling, and that of
discovery. He crossed this tract very slowly,
often pausing, sometimes crawling on hands and
knees. Before reaching Oria he heard the faint
dip of oars far below. He knew the customs-guards'
boat sometimes passed the shore of Val
Malghera at night. Surely these were the guards.
Beneath the chestnut trees of Origa he breathed
freely once more. There he was hidden, and
could walk noiselessly on the grass. He descended
the western slope of Val Malghera and climbed up
the other side without encountering any obstacles.
On approaching Rooch his heart beat furiously.
Rooch is a sort of outpost of Oria. There the little
path ends that he had so often followed with
Luisa on mild winter afternoons, gathering violets
and laurel leaves, and talking of the future. He
remembered that the last time, they had had a
discussion concerning the most desirable husband
for Maria, and the qualities he must possess.
Franco had hoped he would be a country gentleman,
but Luisa had been in favour of a civil
engineer.</p>

<p>Rooch is a little farmhouse perched above a
few small fields which lie terraced against the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
hillside, and form a small, light clearing among
the surrounding woods. The stable, a room
above it, a small portico in front of the stable,
a cistern under the portico&mdash;that is all. The little
portico is just above the narrow paved way that
passes some two or three metres below. It is
only a few steps from the comb of the ravine of
Val Malghera, to Rooch. Having reached the comb,
Franco heard low voices in the farmhouse.</p>

<p>He paused and drawing aside, stretched himself,
face downwards, upon the grass, beyond the
path, and near a cluster of low chestnut trees.
The voices became silent, but he heard a man's
steps coming rapidly towards him; he lay quite
still, holding his breath. The man stopped almost
at his side, waited a moment, and then slowly
retraced his steps, saying in a loud voice, with a
foreign accent: "There is no one here, it must
have been a fox."</p>

<p>The guards! A long silence followed, during
which Franco did not dare to move. The guards
once more began to talk, and he decided to crawl
noiselessly backwards, to drop down into Val
Malghera and pass behind and above the house.
Slowly, very slowly he pulled off his boots. He
was about to move when he heard two or three
guards leave the farmhouse, talking as they came
towards him. He heard one of them say: "Is
no one going to stay here?" and another answered:
"It is not necessary."</p>

<p>Four guards brushed past him without noticing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
him. They certainly had no suspicions, for they
were talking unconcernedly. One was saying
that a person may remain ten minutes under
water without drowning; but another maintained
that five minutes is long enough to cause death.
The fourth passed him in silence, but hardly had
he done so when he stopped. Franco shuddered
upon hearing him strike a match. He lit his pipe,
puffed at it two or three times, and then called
out to his companions in a loud voice, for they had
already gone some way down the slope of Val
Malghera.</p>

<p>"How old was she?"</p>

<p>One of the others answered, louder still:</p>

<p>"Three years and one month."</p>

<p>Then the fourth guard puffed twice more and
started forward. Three years and one month!
Maria's age! Franco, lying on his face, raised himself
upon his elbows, clutching convulsively at the
grass. The noise of the steps died away down
below in Val Malghera.</p>

<p>"My God! My God!" he cried. Rising to his
knees he repeated the terrible words in his heart,
slowly, as if stupefied. "<i>She was!</i>" He wrung his
hands, moaning once more: "My God! My God!"</p>

<p>After this he was hardly conscious of his movements.
He went down to Oria with the vague
sensation of having grown suddenly deaf, and
his arm which clasped the doll trembled violently.
Reaching the Madonna del Romit he crossed the
town, and instead of going down by the Pomodoro
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
stairway he followed the path that joins the short
cut to Albogasio Superiore, and descended those
same stairs that Barborin Pasotti had descended
the day before the catastrophe. On the wall of
the church he noticed a pale light which was
reflected from the alcove-room. He neither
paused beneath the window, nor called out, but
stepped under the porch and tried the door.</p>

<p>It was open.</p>

<p>From the coolness of the night he passed into
a heavy, close atmosphere, laden with the unfamiliar
odour of burnt vinegar and incense.
With difficulty he dragged himself up the stairs.
Before him, on the landing, half-way up, light fell
from above. On reaching the spot he saw that
the light came from the alcove-room. He went
on and presently stood in the corridor. The door
of the room was wide open; there must be many
candles burning in there. Mingled with the odour
of incense he recognised the perfume of flowers,
and began to tremble so violently that he could
not go on. No sound reached him from the room.
Suddenly he heard Luisa's voice, speaking tenderly,
quietly: "Do you want me to go where you
are going to-morrow, Maria? Do you want your
mamma under the ground with you?" "Luisa!
Luisa!" sobbed Franco, and they found themselves
in each others' arms, on the threshold of
their nuptial chamber, where the memory of their
love was still alive, but where its sweet fruit
lay dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
    "Come, dear. Come in," said she, and drew
him forward. In the centre of the room, between
four lighted candles, stood the little open coffin,
in which lay poor Maria, under a mound of flowers,
broken and wilted like herself. There were roses,
heliotrope, jasmine, begonia, geraniums, verbena,
flowering sprays of <i>olea fragrans</i>, and other blossomless
sprays, all dark and shiny, from the carob
tree she had loved so well, because it had been
dear to papa. Flowers and leaves lay across her
face as well.</p>

<p>Franco fell upon his knees sobbing: "My God!
My God!" while Luisa chose two tiny rosebuds,
placed them in Maria's little hand, and kissed her
brow.</p>

<p>"You can kiss her hair," said she, "but not her
face. The doctor does not wish it."</p>

<p>"But you have just done so!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a different thing for me."</p>

<p>But instead he pressed his lips to her icy lips,
that showed among the geraniums and the carob
leaves, touching them gently, as in a tender, but
not despairing farewell to the outward wrapping
now cast aside and empty, which had once belonged
to his beloved baby, who had gone to
dwell elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Maria! My darling Maria!" he whispered between
his sobs. "What was the matter?"</p>

<p>He had not realised the connection between the
guards' talk about drowning and the rest of their
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
    "You have not heard?" said his wife calmly,
and without surprise. They had told her how
the telegram had been worded, but she was also
aware that Ismaele was to have met Franco in
Lugano. She did not know, however, that as
Franco had not arrived by the coach from Ceneri,
Ismaele had gone to bed.</p>

<p>"Poor Franco!" said she, kissing his hair almost
maternally. "There was no illness."</p>

<p>He started to his feet, terrified, and exclaiming:
"What do you mean? There was no illness?"</p>

<p>Leu, the person whom Franco had heard
breathing heavily in her sleep, now came in with
the intention of fumigating the room, but seeing
Franco she stopped in amazement. "Come in,"
said Luisa. "You may place the brazier outside
the door; sprinkle whatever is necessary upon it,
and then return to the kitchen and sleep, my good
Leu." The woman obeyed.</p>

<p>"There was no illness?" Franco repeated.</p>

<p>"Come," his wife answered. "I will tell you
everything."</p>

<p>She made him sit down on the <i>dormeuse</i> at the
foot of their bed. He wished her to sit beside
him, but she made a gesture of refusal, and of
entreaty that he should not insist, that he should
be quiet and wait; then, sinking down on the
floor beside her baby, she began the painful story
in a low, even voice, that sounded almost indifferent
to the tragedy it was relating, a voice
that resembled poor, deaf Barborin's, seeming to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
come from a far-away world. She began with her
meeting with Peppina Bianconi at Campo, and&mdash;always
in the same calm tone&mdash;told him all the
thoughts, all the sentiments that had brought her
to confront his grandmother, told him everything,
down to the moment when she had realised that
Maria was indeed dead. When she had finished
she rose to her knees, and kissing her dead child,
whispered to her: "Now your papa thinks that I
killed you, but it is not true, dear, indeed, it is
not true!"</p>

<p>He rose, quivering with nameless emotion, and
bending over her, raised her&mdash;neither yielding
nor resisting&mdash;from the floor. Touching her
resolutely but tenderly, he placed her on the
<i>dormeuse</i> beside him. He encircled her shoulders
with his arm, pressing her to him, speaking with
his lips on her hair, wetting it with the hot tears,
which from time to time choked his voice. "My
poor Luisa! No, indeed you did not kill her! How
could you suspect me of thinking such a thing?
I bless you instead for all that you have done for
her ever since she came into the world; I, who
have done nothing, bless you who have done so
much. Never say such a thing again! Never,
dear. Our Maria&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A violent sob checked his words, but the man
immediately exerted his strong will, controlled
himself and continued:</p>

<p>"Don't you know what our Maria is saying now?
She is saying: 'My darling mamma, my darling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
papa, now you are all alone, you have only each
other, you are more closely united than ever; give
me to God that He may give me back to you; that
I may become your little guardian angel, and lead
you to Him at last, that we may dwell together
in all eternity,' Do you hear her saying these
words, Luisa?"</p>

<p>She trembled in his arms, shaken by spasmodic
quiverings; her face bent low, resisted Franco
when he would have raised it. At last she took
his hand and kissed it. Then he also kissed her
on the hair, and murmured: "Answer me."</p>

<p>"You are good!" Luisa replied, in a faint and
despairing voice. "You wish to spare me, but
you do not believe what you say. You must feel
that I caused her death, that if I had adopted your
sentiments, your ideas, I should not have left the
house, and if I had not left the house this would
not have happened, and Maria would still be alive."</p>

<p>"Don't think of that, my dear, don't! You
might have believed Maria was with Veronica;
you might have remained in the room with the
fiancés, and the accident would have happened
just the same. Don't think of this any more,
Luisa. Rather listen to what Maria is saying."</p>

<p>"Poor Franco! Poor, poor fellow!" said Luisa,
with such bitterness of terrible hidden meanings,
that his blood ran cold. He shuddered and was
silent, unable to grasp her meaning, and at the
same time dreading an explanation. Slowly they
withdrew from each other's arms, Luisa being the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
first to move. She again took her husband's
hand and wished to carry it to her lips, but Franco
drew her hand tenderly towards him and made a
last attempt.</p>

<p>"Why will you not answer me?"</p>

<p>"I should hurt you too much," she murmured.</p>

<p>He began to realise the irreparable ruin of her
soul, and was silent. He did not withdraw his
hand, but felt his strength deserting him, felt
darkness and icy cold creeping over him, as if
Maria, whom he had evoked in vain, had died a
second time. Anguish, fatigue, the heavy atmosphere,
the mingled odours of the room,
affected him so strongly that he was obliged to
go out, or he would have fainted.</p>

<p>He went to the loggia. The windows were
open and the sweet, fresh air restored him. Out
there in the dark he wept for his little daughter
unrestrainedly, without even that restraint which
light imposes. He knelt by one of the windows,
crossed his arms on his breast and wept, his face
raised towards heaven, tears and words flowing
together, disjointed words of anguish and of faith,
calling out to God for help, to God, to God who
had dealt him the blow. With streaming eyes
he cried out, begging that his tears might continue
to flow, confessing that he knew full well
why the child had died. Had he not prayed again
and again that God would preserve her from the
danger of losing her faith through her mother's
influence? Ah! that last night! That last night
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
when Maria had said to him: "Darling papa, a
kiss!" and so many other tender things, and would
not let go his hand, how he had prayed! The
memory of it was a terror, a joy, a spasm to him.
"Lord, Lord!" said he, gazing heavenward.
"Thou wert silent, but my voice reached Thee.
Thou hast answered my prayer in Thine own
mysterious way. Thou hast taken my treasure to
Thyself, she is safe, she is happy, she awaits me.
Thou wilt reunite us." The fast-falling tears
that accompanied his last words had no bitter
taste, but presently, while thinking once more of
that last night, he was bitterly sorry he had left
Maria without telling her that he had deceived her.
"Maria, my own Maria!" he entreated, weeping,
"forgive me!" Good God! it seemed impossible
that all this could be true; it seemed impossible
that if he went into the alcove-room he should
not find her there asleep in her little bed, her head
drooping towards her shoulder and her tiny hands
resting, palms upward, upon the sheet. Indeed
she was still there, but&mdash;&mdash;! Oh! how awful it
all was! Surely his tears would never end.</p>

<p>Leu came in bringing a light and a cup of coffee.
The Signora had sent her. He felt a thrill of
tender gratitude towards his wife. Good God!
Poor Luisa! How hopeless was her grief! And
what an awful semblance of punishment for her
in the blow which had fallen upon her at that very
moment, that very moment! She herself had
realised that he must think this, and he did indeed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
think it, but had denied his thought in order to
spare her, and this she had also realised. And
was this awful semblance of punishment destined
not to bear any fruit whatsoever? She seemed
to shrink from God more than ever now, and who
could tell how far she might wander! Poor, poor
Luisa! It was not Maria he should pray for, Maria
did not need his prayers. He must pray for Luisa,
pray night and day, trusting also in the prayers of
the precious little soul now hidden in God.</p>

<p>He talked with Leu, feeling more calm now, and
had her tell him all she had seen, all she had heard
of this terrible event. "The Lord wanted your
little child for Himself," said Leu at last. "If
you could only have seen her in church, with her
little folded hands and her serious little face! She
looked just like an angel. Indeed she did."
Then she asked Franco if she should leave the
light. No, he preferred to be in the dark. At
what time was the funeral to take place? At
eight o'clock, Leu thought. When Leu once
began talking it was always hard for her to leave
off, and perhaps now she was afraid of staying in
the kitchen all alone. "Her papa!" she added,
before going out. "Her dear papa! It isn't more
than a week ago that I came here with some chestnuts
for the Signora, and that blessed little creature,
who spoke so well, for all the world like a
lawyer, said to me: 'Do you know, Leu, my papa
is coming to Lugano very soon, and I am going to
see him.' Oh, dear! What a dreadful thing!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
    His tears flowed afresh. Ah, God had taken
the child to save her from the errors of the world.
God had punished Luisa for her errors, but was
not this awful punishment intended for him also?
Was he not guilty also? Ah, yes! Very, very
guilty! A clear vision of his past life rose before
him, his life, barren of all useful labour, full of
vanities, corresponding ill with the beliefs he
professed, a life which rendered him responsible
for Luisa's unbelief. The world accounted him
virtuous for certain qualities he possessed through
no merit of his own, for they were inborn in him,
and he felt that for this very reason God's judgment
of him must be doubly severe; for God had
endowed him richly, and he had gathered no fruit.
Once more he fell upon his knees and humbly
accepted his punishment, in the desolate contrition
of his heart, in his burning desire to expiate,
to purify himself, to become worthy of re-union
with Maria at last.</p>

<p>A long, long time he prayed and wept. At last
he went out to the terrace. Above Galbiga and
the hills of the Lake of Como the sky was growing
light; day was breaking. From neighbouring
Boglia a cold north wind was blowing. From far
and near, from the lake shore, from the lofty
bosom of the valley, bells rang out. The thought
that Maria and Grandmother Teresa were together
and happy, rose suddenly, clear and sweet
in Franco's heart. It seemed to him the Lord
was saying to him: "I afflict thee, but I love thee.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Wait, be steadfast, and thou shalt know." The
bells chimed far and near, from the lake shore
and from the lofty bosom of the valley. The
sky grew ever brighter above Galbiga and towards
the Lake of Como, along the steep, black profile
of the Picco di Cressogno; and the sweep of smooth
water down there in the East, between the great
shadows of the mountains, was like a shining pearl.
The sprays of the passion-flower vine, touched by
the north wind, waved silently above Franco's
head, in quivering anticipation of the light, of
the immense glory that was rising out of the
east, colouring clouds and clear sky with itself,
and welcomed by the bells.</p>

<p>To live, to live, to work, suffer, adore, and
ascend! That was what the light demanded!
He must carry the living away in his arms, carry
the dead away in his heart, return to Turin, work
for Italy, die for her! The dawning day demanded
this. Italy! Italy! Beloved Mother! Franco
clasped his hands in a transport of desire.</p>

<p>Luisa heard the bells also. She wished that she
might not have heard them, wished that day
might never dawn, bringing with it the hour in
which Maria must be consigned to the grave.
On her knees beside her baby's little body she
promised her that every day of her life she would
come and talk to her, bring her flowers, and bear
her company; morning and evening she would
come. Then she sank down and gave herself up
to those dark thoughts which she had not wished
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
to confess to her husband, and which had grown
and matured in her during the last twenty-four
hours, as a malignant infection of remote origin
which has lain dormant in the system, being caught
up at last in the current of the blood, suddenly
bursts forth with overwhelming violence.</p>

<p>All her religious views, her faith in the existence
of God, her scepticism concerning the immortality
of the soul were tending towards subversion.
She was convinced that she was in no way responsible
for Maria's death. If indeed there did exist
an Intelligence, a Will, a Power which was master
of men and of things, then the monstrous guilt was
of this Intelligence, which had coldly pre-ordained
Barborin Passotti's visit and gift; had withdrawn
Maria from those who should have watched
over her in her mother's absence; had lured her,
defenceless, towards destruction; had killed her.
That same Power had checked her, the mother,
when she had been about to perform an act of
justice. Fool that she was, ever to have believed
in Divine Justice! There was no such thing as
Divine Justice! Instead there was the altar allied
to the throne; the Austrian God, a party to all
injustice, all tyranny, author of suffering, and of
evil, slayer of the innocent and protector of the
wicked. Ah! if such a God did indeed exist, it
were better that Maria be there in that body,
better that no part of her should live on to fall
into the toils of this fiendish Omnipotence!</p>

<p>But it was possible to doubt the existence of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
this horrible God. And if He did not exist we
might desire that a part of a human being should
continue to live beyond the grave, live not miraculously,
but naturally. That was perhaps easier
to conceive than the existence of an invisible
tyrant, of a Creator who was cruel to the beings
of His own creation. The rule of nature without
God was certainly preferable; better a blind
master, who was not our enemy, not deliberately
cruel. But henceforth, at least, no thought must
be wasted in any way, either in this life or in the
next&mdash;if, indeed, the next exist&mdash;upon that vain
phantom, Justice!</p>

<p>The faint light of dawn mingled with her
thoughts as it had mingled with Franco's thoughts,
solemn and consoling to him, hateful to her. He,
the Christian, meditated an insurrection of wrath
and of arms against brothers in Christ, for love of
a dot upon the surface of one of Heaven's orbs;
she meditated an immense rebellion, the liberation
of the Universe. Her thought might be the
greater, her intellect might appear the stronger,
but he whom the human generations learn to know
even better as they advance in civilisation and
science; He who allows each generation to honour
Him according to its strength, and who gradually
transforms and raises the ideals of the nations,
making use even of inferior and fleeting ideals,
when He deems it opportune, in His government
of the world; He who, being Peace and Life, has
allowed Himself to be called the God of armies,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
had impressed the sign of His judgment upon the
face of the woman and upon the face of the man.
While dawn burned into the glory of sunrise,
Franco's brow became ever more brightly illumined
by a light from within, and through his
tears his eyes shone with the vigour of life; but
Luisa's brow grew ever darker, and from the
depths, the shadows mounted to her dull eyes.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>As the sun rose a boat came in sight off the point
of Caravina. It brought the lawyer, V., who had
come from Varenna in obedience to Luisa's call.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
PHANTOMS</h2>

<p>On the evening of that same day a numerous
company assembled in the Marchesa's
red drawing-room. Pasotti had brought his
unlucky wife by main force, and he had brought
Signor Giacomo Puttini also, although that
gentleman had held out for some time against the
most gracious Controller's despotic caprices. The
curate of Puria and Paolin had also put in an appearance,
both being anxious to observe the effects
of the tragedy on the old lady's marble countenance.
Paolin of course dragged the worthy
Paolon in his wake, he being still in a state of
limp and sheepish resistance. The curate of
Cima, who was devoted to the Marchesa, came
also, as did the prefect of Caravina, whose heart
really belonged to Franco and Luisa, but who,
as parish-priest of Cressogno, was bound to treat
their enemy with a certain amount of consideration.</p>

<p>She received them all with her usual impassive
expression, with her usual calm greeting. Signora
Barborin, who had been cautioned by her master
against alluding to the event at Oria, was made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
to sit on the sofa beside her hostess, who graciously
accepted the homage of the others, put the usual
questions to Paolin and Paolon concerning their
respective consorts, and having satisfied herself
that both Paolina and Paolona were enjoying the
best of health, she folded her hands over her
stomach and relapsed into dignified silence, her
courtiers forming a semicircle around her.
Pasotti, noting the absence of Friend, inquired
for him with obsequious solicitude. "And Friend?
Dear little Friend?" Although, had he had him
in his clutches&mdash;<i>solus cum solo</i>&mdash;the nasty, little
snarling beast which worried his trousers and
his wife's skirts, he would have joyfully wrung his
neck. Friend had been ill for two days. The
entire company was greatly affected by this news,
and loudly deplored the misfortune, secretly
hoping the while that the accursed little monster
might not recover. Barborin, not hearing a
word, but seeing so many mouths at work, so
many faces assuming a look of affliction, naturally
supposed they were speaking of Oria, and turning
to her neighbour Paolon, questioned him with
her eyes, opening her mouth and pointing towards
Oria. Paolon shook his head. "They are talking
about the little dog," said he. The deaf woman
did not understand, but she said: "Ah!" on
general principles, and assumed an expression of
affliction like the rest.</p>

<p>Friend ate too much, and his food was too rich,
and he was now suffering from a disgusting skin
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
disease. Paolin and the curate of Puria gave
much careful advice. The prefect of Caravina
had elsewhere expressed the charitable opinion
that the creature ought to be pitched into the lake
with his mistress tied to his neck. While the
others were discussing the favourite with such
lively interest, the prefect was thinking of Luisa
as he had seen her that morning, her features
distorted, opposing mad resistance first to the
closing of the coffin, and then to its removal.
He was thinking how, in the cemetery, she with
her own hands had cast the earth upon her child,
telling her to be patient, that she herself would
soon come and lie down beside her, and that that
would be their Paradise.</p>

<p>In spite of the animated and eager conversation
concerning the mangy Friend, the phantoms of
the dead child and the distracted mother were
hovering in the room. Presently there came a
moment of silence when no one could think of
anything more to say about the dog, and then the
two unhappy phantoms were heard by all, demanding
that they speak of them, and all could
see them distinctly in the eyes of one who loved
them, in the eyes of poor, deaf Barborin. Her
husband at once sought a diversion, and propounded
a problem in <i>tarocchi</i> to Signor Giacomo.
The other <i>tarocchi</i> enthusiasts immediately took up
the question, the voices of the phantoms could no
longer be heard, and every one breathed more freely.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock. Usually at that hour the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
footman would come in with two lighted candles,
and prepare the little <i>tarocchi</i> table in one corner
of the room, between the great fireplace and the
balcony on the West. Then the Marchesa would
rise and say, with her habitual, drowsy calm:</p>

<p>"If you are ready&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two or three guests would invariably answer:
"Quite ready," and then the three-handed
or four-handed game would begin.</p>

<p>The old footman&mdash;who was devotedly attached
to Don Franco&mdash;hesitated that night about bringing
the candles. He did not believe it possible
that his mistress and her guests would have the
courage to play. At five minutes past nine, as
the footman had not yet appeared, each one
began privately commenting upon the delay.
Before entering the house Paolin had maintained
that there would be no playing, while the prefect
had maintained the contrary. He now cast a
triumphant glance at his adversary, as did also
Paolon, who, from a spirit of solidarity with the
other Paul, was pleased that he should be in the
right. Pasotti, who had felt sure of his game,
began to show signs of uneasiness. At seven
minutes past nine the Marchesa requested the
prefect to ring the bell. It was now the prefect's
turn to bestow a triumphant glance on Paolin,
and he put into it all the silent contempt for the
old woman that it would hold.</p>

<p>"Prepare the table," said the Marchesa to the
footman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
    He soon returned with the two candles. From
the depths of his sorrowful eyes also, the phantom
of the dead child looked forth. While he was
busy arranging the candles, the cards, and the
ivory counters on the table, the room was
enveloped in that silence which always preceded
the rising of the Marchesa. But the Marchesa
showed no intention of rising. She turned to
Pasotti, saying:</p>

<p>"Controller, if you and the others wish to
play&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marchesa," Pasotti promptly replied, "my
wife's presence must not deter you from enjoying
your game. Barborin is not a good player, but
she delights in looking on."</p>

<p>"I shall not play this evening," the Marchesa
answered, and although the tone was mild, the
refusal was decisive.</p>

<p>The worthy Paolon, who was always silent and
could not play <i>tarocchi</i>, believed he had at last
discovered a word which was both wise and obsequious,
and which he might safely utter:</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said he.</p>

<p>Pasotti gave him a surly glance, thinking:
"What business is it of his?" but he did not venture
to speak. The Marchesa appeared not to
have noticed Paolon's utterance, and added:</p>

<p>"The others can play if they like."</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed the prefect. "We should
not think of such a thing!"</p>

<p>Pasotti drew his snuff-box from his pocket.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
"The <i>Signor Prefetto</i>," said he, speaking very
distinctly, and slightly raising his open hand,
a pinch of snuff between the thumb and forefinger,
"The <i>Signor Prefetto</i> must speak for himself.
For my part, as the Signora Marchesa
wishes us to play, I am quite willing to oblige her."</p>

<p>The Marchesa was silent, and the fiery prefect,
encouraged by her silence, grumbled in an undertone:</p>

<p>"After all, we are in a house of mourning."</p>

<p>Never since Franco had left the house had his
name been mentioned at these evening assemblies
in the red drawing-room, nor had the Marchesa
even alluded either to him or to his wife. She
now broke the silence that had lasted four years.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the baby," said she, "but as
for her father and mother, the Almighty has seen
fit to punish them."</p>

<p>No one spoke. After some minutes Pasotti
said in a low and solemn tone:</p>

<p>"A fearful punishment!"</p>

<p>And the curate of Cima added in a louder voice:</p>

<p>"A manifest punishment!"</p>

<p>Paolin dared not remain silent, neither did he
dare speak, so he ejaculated: "Dear, dear!"
and this encouraged Paolon to repeat his "Exactly!"
Signor Giacomo simply puffed.</p>

<p>"A chastisement from the Almighty!" the
curate of Cima repeated with emphasis. "And
also, considering the circumstances, a mark of His
especial regard for some one else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
    All, save the prefect, who was chafing inwardly,
looked at the Marchesa as if the protecting hand
of the Omnipotent were suspended above her wig.
But instead that Divine Hand was hovering above
the lofty bonnet of Barborin Pasotti, and was
keeping her ears tightly closed, that they might
not hear those contaminating and iniquitous
words. "Curate," said Pasotti, "as the Signora
Marchesa has proposed it, shall we have a little
game? You, Paolin, Signor Giacomo, and I?"</p>

<p>The four, seated in their corner at the little
card table, at once gave themselves up to the
luxury of unrestrained conversation, and to the
enjoyment of certain stale, Ambrosian<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> witticisms,
which cling to the <i>tarocchi</i> cards like grease.</p>

<p>"I shall get there first!" Pasotti exclaimed
after the first round, laughing loudly, with the
intention of proclaiming both his victory and his
good spirits.</p>

<p>The players had rid themselves of the phantoms;
not so the others. The deaf woman, sitting stiff
and motionless on the sofa, had suffered mortal
anguish, dreading a gesture from her husband
which should command her to play. Oh, dear
Lord! was she to be made to suffer this also?
By the grace of Heaven the sign was not given,
and her first feeling upon seeing the four seat
themselves at the little table had been one of
relief. But at once bitter disgust seized her.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
What an insult that game was to her Luisa!
What contempt it showed for poor, dear little
Maria, who was dead! No one spoke to her, no
one noticed her, so she began to recite in her heart
a string of <i>Paters</i>, <i>Aves</i>, and <i>Glorias</i>, for the soul
of that wicked creature seated at the other end
of the sofa, who was so old, so rapidly approaching
the moment when she must appear before her
God. She repeated, for her benefit, the prayer
for the conversion of sinners which she had been
in the habit of repeating night and morning for
her husband's benefit, ever since she had discovered
his over-familiarity with a certain menial
attached to her household.</p>

<p>When the prefect heard Pasotti's outburst of
mirth, he rose to take his leave. "Wait," said
the Marchesa, "you must have a glass of wine."
At half-past nine a precious bottle of old San
Colombano was usually brought in. "I shall
not drink to-night," said the prefect heroically,
"I have been greatly upset ever since this morning.
Puria knows why."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" said Puria softly. "Of course
it was a terrible tragedy."</p>

<p>Silence. The prefect bowed to the Marchesa,
saluted Signor Pasotti with an expression that
said: "You and I understand each other," and
left the room.</p>

<p>The curate of Puria, who was possessed of a big
body and a level head, was studying the Marchesa
without appearing to do so. Was she or was she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
not affected by the events at Oria? Her having
refrained from playing seemed to him a doubtful
symptom. She might have done so simply out of
respect for her own flesh and blood. On closer
observation the curate noticed that her hands
trembled; this was unusual. She forgot to ask
Pasotti if the wine was good; this also was unusual.
Her face with its waxen mask, twitched
violently from time to time; this was extremely
unusual. "She is touched!" thought the curate.
As she was perfectly silent, and as Signora Pasotti
and Paolon were also silent, the whole group
seemed turned to stone. Puria cast about for
a means of breaking the ice, but could find nothing
better than to induce those three heads to
turn towards the card-table, while he commented
upon Pasotti's exclamations, upon Paolin's and
Signor Giacomo's ejaculations and puffings. The
Marchesa roused herself somewhat, and expressed
her satisfaction that the players were enjoying
themselves. Barborin neither heard nor spoke
a word, so the three others ended by talking about
her. The Marchesa complained that she was so
deaf it was impossible to converse with her. The
other two lavished upon her all the praise she so
richly deserved, the praise all those who remember
her still lavish upon her. There she sat, sad and
speechless, never suspecting that she was the subject
of their conversation. The Lord protected
her profound and simple meekness, by never
allowing the praises of the world to enter into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
her ears, but only the scoldings of her worthy
consort.</p>

<p>Her great, sorrowful black eyes brightened
when Signor Giacomo uttered a loud and final
puff, and his companions, dropping their cards,
threw themselves back in their respective chairs
to rest a little and reflect upon the delights of the
game. At last her master approached the sofa,
and motioned to her to rise. For the first time
in her life, perhaps, she was glad to get into the
boat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When her guests had left, the Marchesa rang
the bell for the rosary, which they had not been
able to repeat at the usual hour. The rosary
was a living thing in Casa Maironi, having its
roots in the Marchesa's past sins, and its growth
was steady, for it was always putting forth fresh
<i>Aves</i> and <i>Glorias</i>, as the old lady became more
advanced in years, and saw her own disgusting
skull looming before her, ever more distinct, ever
more apparent. Consequently her rosary was
extremely long. The sweet peccadillos of her
protracted youth did not trouble her conscience
over-much, but there were certain other transgressions
which could be computed in pounds,
shillings, and pence, transgressions never properly
confessed and therefore never properly forgiven,
and these caused her great uneasiness; an uneasiness
she was continually trying to stifle by means
of rosaries, but which was forever bursting out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
afresh. While she was praying to the Great
Creditor for the remission of her debts, she would
feel perfect confidence in His power to remit
them all, but later there would once more loom
before her mind's eye the sorrowful faces of the
lesser creditors, bringing with them doubts concerning
the pardon received, and thus her avarice
and her pride were ever struggling against the fear
of a perpetual debtor's prison beyond the tomb.</p>

<p>When they had recited the prayers for the
conversion of sinners, and those for the healing of
the sick, and were about to begin the <i>De Profundis</i>,
she announced three new <i>Ave Marias</i>, without,
however, stating for what purpose. The scullery
maid, a simple peasant from Cressogno, supposed
these <i>Ave Marias</i> were intended for the unhappy
family at Oria, and recited them with extreme
fervour. The scullery-maid's <i>Aves</i> clashed with
and routed those of her mistress, which were asking
for sleep, and rest for the nerves and conscience.
As to the <i>Ave Marias</i> of all the others,
they were repeated in the common hope that
they might not remain definitely attached to the
rosary, as too often happened. In short, no one
succeeded in checking the onward march of the
ghost.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock the Marchesa retired.
She drank some citron-water, and the maid having
begun to talk of Oria and of Don Franco, who, it
was whispered, had returned, she ordered her to
be silent. She was certainly affected. She saw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
continually before her eyes the image of Maria as
she had once seen her when passing in her gondola
below the little Gilardoni villa; a slight figure in
a white apron, with long hair and bare arms, and
strangely like a child of her own who had died
when only three. Did she feel affection or pity?
She herself could not tell what she felt. Perhaps
it was only irritation and terror at not being able
to rid herself of an annoying image; perhaps it was
fear at the thought that if a certain great sin had
not been committed long ago, if Marchese Franco's
will had not been burnt, the child would not have
died.</p>

<p>When she was in bed she had the maid read
some prayers to her, then she ordered her to put
out the light, and finally dismissed her. She
closed her eyes, trying not to think of anything,
and saw beneath her eyelids, a shapeless, light
spot, which little by little transformed itself into
a small pillow, then into a letter, then into a large
white chrysanthemum, and at last into a pale,
drooping, dead face, that gradually grew smaller
and smaller. She fancied she was falling asleep,
but as a result of this last transformation the
thought of the child shot through her heart, and
although she saw nothing more beneath her eyelids,
her drowsiness vanished, and she opened
her eyes, vexed and uneasy. She determined to
think out a game of <i>tarocchi</i> in order to drive away
these troublesome fancies, and induce sleep. She
thought of the game, and succeeded, by an effort,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
in seeing in her mind's eye the little card-table,
the players, the candles, the cards; but when she
relaxed the tension of effort, in order to give herself
up to a passive contemplation of these soporific
phantoms, something totally different appeared
beneath her eyelids&mdash;a head which was continually
changing its features, its expression, its
position, and which, at last, slowly drooped forward,
as in sleep or death, so that she could only
see the hair. This was another shock to her
nerves. The Marchesa once more opened her
eyes, and heard the clock on the stairs begin to
strike. She counted the strokes; twelve o'clock.
It was already midnight, and she could not get
to sleep! She lay some time with wide open eyes,
and now images began to appear in the dark as
they had before appeared beneath her eyelids.
At first there was only a formless nucleus, which
soon began to undergo transformation. She saw
the face of a clock which presently turned into the
horrible eye of a fish, and then became an angry,
human eye. Suddenly the Marchesa felt quite
sure she would not be able to go to sleep at all, and
once more the drowsiness that had already taken
firm hold on her, was put to flight. Then she
rang the bell.</p>

<p>The maid let her ring twice, and then came in,
half dressed and sleepy. She was ordered to
place the candle upon a chair in such a position
that the flame might not be visible from the bed,
to get a volume of Barbieri's sermons, and to read
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
in a low voice. The maid was in the habit of
administering these narcotics. She began to read,
but at the end of the second page, hearing her
mistress's breathing grow deeper, she very gradually
lowered her voice, until it became only an
inarticulate murmur, and finally lapsed into
silence. She waited a moment, listening to the
deep and regular breathing, then rose and went to
look at the dark face turned upwards on the
pillows, with wrinkled brow and half-open mouth.
Then she took up the candle and went out
on tiptoe.</p>

<p>The Marchesa was asleep and dreaming. She
was dreaming that she was stretched on a bed of
straw in a great dark dungeon, chains upon her
ankles, and accused of murder. The judge entered
with a light, sat down beside her, and read
her a sermon on the necessity of confession.
She kept protesting that she was innocent, and
repeating: "Don't you know she was drowned?"
The judge made no answer, but went on reading
in a mournful and solemn voice, while the Marchesa
insisted: "No, no! I did not kill her!" In her
dream she was no longer phlegmatic, but writhed
like one in despair. "Remember that the child
herself says so," the judge replied. He rose to
his feet, repeating: "She says so." Then he
struck the palm of one hand loudly upon the palm
of the other, and called out: "Enter!" Thus far
the Marchesa had been conscious in her dream
that she was dreaming; at this point she thought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
she awoke, and saw with horror, that some one
had indeed entered the room.</p>

<p>A human form, slightly luminous, was seated
in the armchair heaped with clothes that stood
beside her bed, but in such a position that she
could not distinguish the lower part of the apparition.
Its shoulders, arms, and clasped hands
were of a whitish hue, and indistinct in outline,
but its head, that rested against the chair-back,
was distinctly visible, and surrounded by a pale
light. The dark, living eyes were staring at the
Marchesa. Oh, horror! It was indeed the dead
child! Oh, horror! Oh, horror! The eyes of the
apparition spoke, and accused her. The judge was
right, the child was saying so&mdash;without words&mdash;with
her eyes! "It was you who did it, Grandmother,
you! I should have been born, should
have lived under your roof. You would not
have it. Your punishment shall be death everlasting!"</p>

<p>The eyes alone, the staring, sad, pitiful eyes
said all these things at once. The Marchesa
uttered a long groan, and stretched out her arms
towards the apparition, trying to say something,
and succeeding only in gasping out: "Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&mdash;"
while the hands, the arms, the shoulders
of the phantom vanished in a mist, the outlines
of its face became blurred, and only the gaze
remained, staring intently, and then finally becoming
veiled was absorbed, as it were, into a
deep and distant Self, nothing remaining of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
apparition save a slight phosphorescence which
was presently lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>The Marchesa awoke with a start. In her
agitation she forgot the bell, and tried to call out,
but could not raise her voice. By an effort of
her will, which was still strong in spite of her
failing bodily strength, she thrust her legs out of
bed, and stood upright. She staggered forward
a step or two in the dark, stumbling against the
easy-chair, and clutched at another chair, dragging
it down with her as she fell heavily to the ground,
where she lay moaning.</p>

<p>The noise of the fall roused the maid, who
called out to her mistress, but receiving no answer,
and hearing the moaning, she lighted her
candle and hastened into the room, where, in the
dim light between the armchair and the bed she
saw something large and white that was writhing
on the floor like some huge marine monster, that
has been cast upon the shore. She screamed and
rushed to the bell, rousing the whole house at
once, and then hastened to help the old woman,
who was groaning: "The priest! The priest!
The prefect! The prefect!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
FLIGHT</h2>

<p>At half-past two that same night Franco,
Lawyer V., and their friend Pedraglio were
sitting in the loggia in the dark, and in silence.
Suddenly Pedraglio started up exclaiming: "What
can that fool be about?" Going out to the terrace
he listened a moment and then returned to
the room. "No sign of him," said he. "Oh,
I say! Are we to sit here like idiots and wait
for them to come and take us, and all on account
of that silly ass, who has probably fallen asleep?
Maironi, you are fairly well acquainted with the
road, and we all three have plenty of courage. If
it should be necessary to pitch into anybody we
should be quite equal to the occasion. Don't
you think so, V.?"</p>

<p>The night before, between seven and eight
o'clock, Pedraglio had happened to be on the road
between Loveno and Menaggio. At the spot that
goes by the name of "Bertin's Cove" a man had
begged of him, had pressed a note into his hand,
and had then walked rapidly away. The note
ran as follows: "Why does Carlino Pedraglio
not go to Oria at once, to see Signor Maironi and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
the lawyer from Varenna, and take a nice little
walk with his dear friends over beyond the stake?"</p>

<p>Ever since the arrest of his friend the doctor at
Pellio, Pedraglio had been expecting some sign
from the police, and this note was not the first
timely and ungrammatical warning which had
reached a patriot. The note spoke plainly; he
must pass the stake that marked the frontier
without delay. Pedraglio knew nothing of Franco's
misfortune and return, nor was he aware of the
lawyer's presence in Oria. He did not stop to
speculate, however, but hastened to Loveno,
provided himself with money, and started off on
foot. He would not risk going to Porlezza, but
took the path that from a spot near Tavordo rises
upwards through a lonely ravine to the Passo
Stretto. As nimble as a chamois, he reached
Oria in four hours, and found Franco and the
lawyer preparing to start, another mysterious
warning having reached them through the curate
of Castello, who had been to Porlezza, and had
there been charged with the message, in the confessional.
Ismaele was to guide them across the
frontier. The passes of Boglia were very carefully
guarded, and Ismaele proposed passing between
Monte della Neve and Castello; then they
would drop down into the valley, making straight
for the Alpe di Castello below the Sasso Grande,
and from there descend to Cadro, an hour above
Lugano.</p>

<p>But Ismaele was to have been there at two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
o'clock, and at half-past two he had not yet
appeared.</p>

<p>Luisa was also up. She was in the alcove-room
mending a pair of Maria's stockings, which she
intended to place on the little bed, where she had
arranged all of the child's little garments with the
same care as when the little one was alive. She
had not wished to see either the lawyer or Pedraglio.
After her intense excitement at the funeral
her grief had once more assumed that gloomy
aspect which caused Dr. Aliprandi still greater
anxiety. She was no longer excited; she did
not even speak, and she had never yet wept.
Her manner towards Franco exhibited nothing
but pity for this man who loved her, and whose
affection and presence were, in spite of herself,
perfectly indifferent to her. Franco, relying upon
obtaining the position his director had talked so
much about, had proposed taking the whole
family back to Turin with him. Uncle Piero,
poor old man, was quite ready to make this new
sacrifice, but Luisa had stated explicitly that rather
than leave her little daughter, she would end her
days in the lake.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Upon hearing the proposal to start without
Ismaele, Franco rose and said he would go and
take leave of his wife. Just at that moment the
lawyer heard a step in the street below.
"Silence!" said he. "Here he is." Franco
went out to the terrace. Some one was, indeed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
coming from the direction of Albogasio. Franco
waited until the wayfarer had reached the church-place,
and then called out in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Ismaele?"</p>

<p>"It is I," a voice answered that was not Ismaele's.
"It is the prefect. I am coming up-stairs."</p>

<p>The prefect at that hour? What could have
happened? Franco went to the kitchen, lighted
a candle, and then hastened downstairs.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed and he had not returned
to his friends. But meanwhile Ismaele's wife
had appeared to say that her husband was feeling
very ill, and could not stir. She stood in the
square, and spoke to Pedraglio, who was on the
terrace. He hastened to summon Franco, and
found him on the stairs, coming up with the prefect.
"The guide is ill," said he, knowing the
priest to be an honest man. "Let us start at
once, and not waste any more time." Franco
replied that he could not start immediately, and
that they must go on ahead. How was this?
Why could he not start? No, he could not. He
ushered the prefect into the hall, called the lawyer,
and tried to persuade both Pedraglio and him to
start at once. Something extraordinary had
happened, about which he must consult his wife,
and he could not say what he might decide to do.
His friends protested that they would not forsake
him. The jovial Pedraglio, who was in the habit
of spending more money than his father approved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
of, observed that if the worst came to the worst,
they would be able to live more economically and
more virtuously at Josephstadt or Kufstein than
in Turin, and that this would be a consolation to
his "governor." "No, no!" exclaimed Franco.
"You must go! Prefect, you persuade them!"
And he went towards the alcove-room.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to start?" said Luisa, in that
voice which seemed to come from a far-away
world. "Good-bye."</p>

<p>He came to her side, and stooped to kiss the
little stocking she held. "Luisa," he whispered,
"the Prefect of Caravina is here." She did not
express the slightest astonishment. "Grandmother
sent for him an hour or two ago," Franco
continued. "She told him she had seen our
Maria, shining like an angel."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lie!" Luisa exclaimed, in a tone
full of contempt, but not angrily. "As if it were
possible she would go to her and not come to me!"</p>

<p>"Maria has touched her heart," Franco went
on. "She begs us to pardon her. She fears she
is dying, and entreats me to come to her, to bring
her a word of peace from you also."</p>

<p>Franco himself did not believe in the apparition,
being profoundly sceptical of everything that was
supernatural outside of religion, but he did believe
that Maria, in her higher state, had already
been able to work a miracle, and touch his grandmother's
heart, and the thought caused him
indescribable emotion. Luisa remained like ice.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
She was not even irritated, as Franco had feared
she would be, by the proposal to send a friendly
message. "Your grandmother fears hell," she
observed with her mortal coldness. "Hell does
not exist, and so all this amounts to nothing more
than a fright. The suffering is not great. Let
her bear it, and then die as we all must, and so,
'Amen.'" Franco saw it would be useless to
insist. "Then I will go," said he. She was silent.</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall be able to come back this
way," Franco added. "I shall have to take to
the hills."</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>"Luisa!" the young man said softly. Reproach,
grief, passion, all these were in his appeal.
Luisa's hands, that had never once paused in their
work, now became still. She murmured:</p>

<p>"I no longer feel anything. I am like a stone."</p>

<p>Franco turned faint. He kissed his wife on her
hair, said good-bye, and then entered the alcove,
where, kneeling beside the little bed, he threw
his arms across it, recalling his treasure's little
voice: "One kiss more, papa!" A paroxysm
of weeping assailed him, but he controlled himself,
and hurriedly left the room.</p>

<p>In the hall his friends were impatiently awaiting
his return. How could they start? They did
not know the way. The lawyer was, indeed,
acquainted with the Boglia road, but was that the
best way to go if they wished to avoid the guards?
On hearing that Franco was going to Cressogno
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
they were filled with amazement, and Pedraglio
gave vent to his indignation, saying it was shameful
to forsake his friends in this fashion, when they
were in trouble. When the prefect realised how
matters stood he took Pedraglio's part, and
offered to explain Franco's absence to his grandmother,
and proposed that Franco should write a
line or two, which he himself would carry to Cressogno.
But Franco was convinced that his
Maria wished him to take this step, and he would
not yield. He suddenly remembered that the
prefect was as familiar as a hare with all the
mountain paths. "You go!" said he, addressing
the priest. "You accompany them!" The prefect
was about to reply that perhaps the Signora
Marchesa might need him, when the lawyer exclaimed:
"Hush! Look there!"</p>

<p>Directly in front of the house, where the shadow
of Monte Bisgnago lay obliquely upon the rippling
water, a boat had stopped. Franco recognised
the customs-guards' launch.</p>

<p>"I am willing to wager those hogs are watching
for us," Pedraglio murmured. "They are afraid
we shall escape by boat. Anyway, they are on
the lookout."</p>

<p>"Hush!" the lawyer repeated, approaching
the window that overlooked the church-place.</p>

<p>All held their breath in silence.</p>

<p>"Children," said V., turning quickly from the
window, "we are done for!" Franco went
to the window, and saw a solitary figure
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
running towards the house. He concluded the
lawyer had given a false alarm, but the man&mdash;it
was he who went by the nickname of "the hunted
hare," and who knew and saw everything&mdash;flung
two words upwards as he passed beneath the
window: "The police!" At the same moment they
heard the noise of many feet. "Come with me!
You also, Prefect!" cried Franco, and the others
following, he made for the little courtyard between
the house and the hillside, and, passing
through a woodshed, reached the short cut that
leads to Albogasio Superiore. It was so dark that
no one noticed a customs-guard, standing,
carbine in hand, not two steps from the door of
the wood-shed. Fortunately this guard, a certain
Filippini, from Busto, was an honest fellow, who
ate the bread of Austria unwillingly, and simply
because he could find no other. "Be quick!"
said he in an undertone. "Cut across the fields,
and then take the Boglia road! The path below
the Madonnina on the left." Franco thanked
the man, and, with his companions, started up
the steep path that comes out on the narrow
communal road of Albogasio Superiore. Half-way
up they all jumped into a field of maize on
the right, and stopped to listen. They heard
steps on the stairs leading upwards from the
church-place, and then on the path where the
guard was posted. Evidently the police wished
to make sure that all the exits were well guarded.
The four crawled swiftly away through the maize,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
and on reaching the spot below a great boulder
called "Lori's Rock," they stopped to hold a
consultation. They might take the path that
comes out on the Albogasio road at the very door
of Pasotti's garden, and then climb up from field
to field, as far as the Boglia road. But the path
would be hard to find at this hour, and fearing to
lose too much time, they determined to make for
the stairway that leads up from Albogasio Inferiore
to Puttini's house, then, leaving Casa
Puttini on the right, they could reach the Boglia
road in no time. It was already less dark. In
one way this was a disadvantage, but at least
it would enable them to find their way through
that labyrinth of small fields and low walls. All
were silent. Only Pedraglio would utter an oath
in Milanese from time to time, as he stumbled
over a stone or scratched his hands on a hedge.
Then the others would hush him. They reached
the narrow stairway preceded by the prefect, who
jumped walls and hedges like a squirrel. When
they were all together on the stairs Franco withdrew
from the group. On the Boglia road they
would not need him; he was going to Cressogno.
In vain Pedraglio seized him by the arm, in vain
the prefect implored him not to expose himself
to certain arrest, and probable imprisonment.
He believed he was obeying Maria's voice, and
felt that he was acting according to the dictates
of conscience. He tore himself from Pedraglio,
and disappeared up the stairs, for he did not wish
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
to go to Cressogno by way of S. Mamette&mdash;that
would be too dangerous.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" said the prefect. "The man is
mad, and we have ourselves to think of."</p>

<p>As they were about to turn the corner of Puttini's
house, they heard people approaching who
were probably going down the stairs. The door
of Puttini's house was open. The friends slipped
inside. The people passed, talking. They were
peasants, and one was saying: "Where the deuce
can he be going at this hour?" Alas, they had met
and recognised Franco! If the gendarmes and the
guards should start out to hunt for the fugitives
and come across these people, they would discover
a trace at once. Towards dawn one is
always sure of meeting people. This time they
had been able to avoid being seen, but a second
time they might be less fortunate, and a meeting
might prove as fatal to Pedraglio and the lawyer
as this one would probably prove to Franco. "If
you could only disguise yourselves as peasants!"
said the priest. A happy thought struck the
lawyer, who had something both of the poet and
the artist, and who was well acquainted with
Puttini. He would take <i>Scior Zacomo's</i> clothes
for Pedraglio, who was also short, and the big,
fat servant's clothes for himself; stuff their own
things into a <i>gerla</i>,<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> fasten it upon his back, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
start for Boglia. The "first political deputy" of
Albogasio might have a hundred reasons for visiting
the forest belonging to the commune. No
sooner said than done! They proceeded upstairs,
and the prefect, who was familiar with the house,
went straight to call Marianna. She did not
answer, and her room was empty. The prefect
guessed at once that the unfaithful servant had
gone to S. Mamette for some secret business transaction,
like that of the oil. That was why they
had found the door open. They went to the
kitchen and lighted two candles. The lawyer took
one and the prefect pointed out <i>Scior Zacomo's</i>
room to him. Meanwhile Pedraglio explored <a name="the" id="the"></a>the
kitchen by the light of the other candle, in
search of "something wet, something to brace
him up."</p>

<p><i>Scior Zacomo</i> slept in a corner room beyond the
hall which the lawyer crossed on tiptoe, picking
his way between piles of chestnuts, walnuts,
filberts, and pears. He approached the door&mdash;it
was closed. He listened&mdash;silence. Very slowly
he turned the handle and pushed. The beastly
door squeaked&mdash;he heard a formidable snort,
and <i>Scior Zacomo</i> cried out angrily: "Go away!
Let me alone! Go away!" The lawyer entered
without further parley. "Away with you, you
accursed woman! Go away, I tell you!" cried <i>Scior
Zacomo</i>, the point of his white night-cap rising out
of the pillows. On catching sight of the lawyer
he began to groan: "Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Oh,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
dear me! For pity's sake, forgive me! I thought
it was my servant. Most distinguished Advocate,
for the love of Heaven, tell me what has happened."</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, <i>Scior Zacomo</i>!" said
the lawyer. "Only the Commissary of Porlezza
is here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, good Lord!" and <i>Scior Zacomo</i> started to
stick his legs out of bed.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, nothing! Be calm, be calm!
Cover yourself up; cover yourself up again! We
are going up to Boglia on account of that accursed
bull, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! What are you talking about?
There is no bull at Boglia at this time of the year.
Oh! I am all bathed in sweat!"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I tell you we are going to see
the place, to see where he used to be. But the
Commissary has very good reasons for strictly
forbidding you to accompany us; he forbids you,
moreover, to go out until we return, and
he has even ordered me to remove your clothes."</p>

<p>Then <a name="he" id="he"></a>he began rapidly collecting Puttini's
garments, commanding him in the name of the
Commissary to be silent. He took possession of
the tall hat, seized the bamboo walking-stick,
ordered the wretched man to bolt the door as soon
as he should have left the room, and to open it
to no one, to speak to no one, until the Commissary's
return; all this in the name of that dreaded
functionary. Then, leaving the poor man more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
dead than alive, he once more joined his companions,
who, by dint of much searching, had
found a filthy dress of Marianna's, a big, red
kerchief for the head, a <i>gerla</i>, and a bottle of
<i>Anesone triduo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> "The deuce!" swore the lawyer,
on examining the loathsome garments he must
don. His disguise was indeed most unsatisfactory.
The skirt was too short, and the kerchief did not
hide his face sufficiently. However there was no
time to look for anything better. But Pedraglio,
in the tall hat, with the bamboo walking-stick
in his hand, was a perfect <i>Scior Zacomo</i>. The
lawyer thrust an old manuscript pamphlet he
found in the kitchen under his friend's arm, and
showed him how to walk and puff. Finally he
took the keys to the wine-cellar, two enormous
keys, gave one to Pedraglio and put the other in
his own pocket. These would prove valuable
weapons in case of need; one, he said, would strike
in the treble key, the other in the bass. And so
they went out, the prefect first, followed by the
false <i>Scior Zacomo</i> puffing like a steam-engine, and
then the false Marianna and her <i>gerla</i> bringing up
the rear. Hardly had they reached the street
when the real Marianna appeared, returning from
S. Mamette with an empty flask. Catching sight
of her master's tall hat looming in the uncertain
light, she faced about and made off as fast as her
legs would carry her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
    "Miserable thief!" the prefect exclaimed. "Excellent!
Your disguise is splendid!" In five minutes
they had reached the Boglia road. Then
the prefect turned homewards, and presently,
hearing people coming up from Albogasio Superiore
talking of gendarmes and guards, he went to
meet them and inquired what had happened.
Oh, nothing very important; only the gendarmes
and soldiers had been to Casa Ribera to arrest
Don Franco Maironi, and, it would appear, lawyer
V. also, for they were sure he must have been
there, and they had been asking every one about
him. However, they had found neither one nor
the other of the friends, although the customs-guards
had been watching the house since midnight.
Now the police were searching all the houses in
Oria, in the belief that the two men must have
escaped by the roof. While the prefect was listening
to this news a boy came running towards
them from the direction of Albogasio Superiore.
They stopped him. "The guards!" he gasped;
"the gendarmes!" He was as white as a sheet;
why he was running away he himself could not
tell, and they found it impossible to gather from
him where the gendarmes were. A woman appeared
on the scene who was able to give them
more information. Four customs-guards and
four gendarmes had just now crossed the square
in Albogasio Superiore. It was rumoured that
Don Franco had been seen on the road to Castello,
and two gendarmes with two guards had started
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
towards the Boglia. The priest shuddered. "Of
course," some one said, "they will cut him off on
the Boglia road." The prefect took some comfort
in the thought that both gendarmes and
guards were now searching for Franco only. He
was so tall, so slender, that neither the false Puttini
nor the false Marianna could possibly be suspected
of being him. Their fate was now beyond his
control, but for Franco he could still do much.
He started for Cressogno, confident that Franco
would reach that place in safety, if the gendarmes
did not discover any fresh traces, for they would
search for him on all the paths leading from
Castello to the frontier, but not on the road to
Cressogno.</p>

<p>Pedraglio and the lawyer accomplished the
first part of the journey from Albogasio to the
stables of Püs, creeping up the precipitous slope
like cats, with long and cautious steps. The lawyer
advanced in silence, but the other was continually
cursing his garments in an undertone.
That "beastly hat," that made his forehead
slippery with grease, that "infernal tail-coat,"
that smelt strong of the sweat of ages. They
reached Püs without having met a living being.
At Püs an old woman came out from between the
stables just after they had passed, and exclaimed
in amazement: "You up here, <i>Scior Giacomo</i>?
At this hour?" "Puff!" murmured the lawyer,
and Pedraglio began to blow, "Apff! Apff!"
like a pair of bellows. "Such paths as these take
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
the breath away, my good sir," said the old
woman. They met no one else until they reached
Sostra.</p>

<p>Sostra, a stable about half-way up the mountain,
with a barn, a shed, and a cistern, lies some distance
back from the path. That path is the very
worst in the whole of Valsolda. It would make
even a wild goat hang its tongue out. Pedraglio
and the lawyer, panting and wet through with
perspiration, turned into the Sostra for a moment's
rest. There all was silence and solitude.
At that height they already breathed a different
air. And how much lower the mountain-tops
had become! And the lake down there in the
depths looked like a river! The lawyer cast
anxious glances upwards towards the first crest
of the Boglia, where the great beech forest begins.
Only half an hour more of climbing! "Come
along!" said he. But Pedraglio, in whose legs
there still lingered the memory of that other long
walk from Loveno to Oria by way of the Passo
Stretto, wanted to rest a little longer, and began
calmly turning over the leaves of Puttini's old
manuscript. It was a monkish poem by some
unknown Cremonese of the seventeenth century.
"Come along," his companion repeated after a
minute or two, and was already preparing to
rise when he heard some one approaching. He
had barely time to whisper, "Look out!" and
turn his back that his face might not be seen.
Pedraglio, though he kept his manuscript close to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
his nose, saw first two customs-guards and then
two gendarmes appear upon the path. He
warned his friend of this in a low tone, and without
turning his head. The two guards halted.
One of them saluted: "My respects, Signor Puttini."
Turning to the gendarmes, he said: "This
gentleman is the first political deputy of
Albogasio." The gendarmes saluted also, and
Pedraglio raised his hat, and held the manuscript
a little higher. The guards wished to rest
awhile, but one of the gendarmes ordered them to
move on, and when the rest of the company had
started forward, he himself approached the Sostra.
He was from Ampezzo, and spoke Italian very
fluently. "You dog! I hope you don't know
me!" thought Pedraglio, vaguely conscious of
his dual personality. "We are in for it, anyway!"</p>

<p>"<i>Signor Deputato Politico</i>," said the man, "did
you happen to see Signor Maironi at Oria this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I? No, indeed. Signor Maironi is in bed and
asleep at this hour."</p>

<p>"And you yourself&mdash;&mdash;where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"I am going up that mountain, up that accursed
Boglia, to see about the communal bull."</p>

<p>"Idiot!" groaned the lawyer inwardly. "He
is making it communal now!" But the "communal"
was allowed to pass unchallenged. The
gendarme, who had a face like a bull-dog, stared
hard at his interlocutor. "You are a political
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
deputy," said he insolently, "and you wear that
thing on your chin?" Instinctively Pedraglio's
hand went to his thin, black, pointed beard, the
abhorred beard of the liberals. "I will cut it
off," said he, with mock seriousness. "Most
certainly, my dear sir! Are you also going up the
Boglia!" Very stiffly the gendarme moved away,
without answering, and all unconscious of the
shameful gibbet to which the political deputy
was consigning him.</p>

<p>The two friends congratulated themselves on
their narrow escape, but they recognised that
the game had become very serious. Now they
had the guards to reckon with, who knew Puttini
well, and they must find a means of avoiding them.
And what if that bull-dog of a gendarme should
blab about the beard? "Come on! Come on!"
said the lawyer. "Let us follow them, and if we
see or hear them turn back we must take to our
heels and make off to the left, towards the
frontier." This would have been a desperate
move, for they were unacquainted with the ground,
with which the guards were undoubtedly familiar.</p>

<p>But in order to catch up with his companions
the bull-dog had to sweat and pant so hard that
when he reached them he had no desire left to
speak of beards. Pedraglio and the lawyer
climbed slowly upwards, and saw the enemy
reach the crest of the hill at the Madonnina beech-tree.
There they halted for some time and then
disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
    The venerable beech-tree, which had the honour
of bearing upon its trunk an image of the Madonna,
which, on its death, it bequeathed to a small
chapel, stood like a sentinel before the great forest
of Boglia, like a soldier posted in this dip of the
crest, to keep watch over the precipitous hillside,
the lake, and the sloping ground of Valsolda. The
venerable army of colossal beeches stood marshalled
in another silent hollow between the slope
of Colmaregia, the easily climbed Dorsi della
Nave, the rocky base of the Denti di Vecchia or
Canne d'Organo, and that other saddle of the
Pian Biscagno, between Colmaregia and the
Sasso Grande, and faced the depths of Val Colla
from Lugano to Cadro. An open, grass-grown
strip of ground stretched along the edge of the
crest, between the Madonnina beech-tree and the
forest. The two fugitives stopped to consider
their position. Which way should they go?
Should they look for the little path below the
beech-tree, of which the guard who had saved them
had spoken, or should they enter the forest? No,
it would be unwise to take to the woods, in the
wake of the game they had just seen enter them.
In the forest they were sure to find the dead
leaves lying ankle-deep, and it would be impossible
to pass through without attracting the attention
of the blood-hounds that were roaming there,
and their disguise would not bear close inspection.
The path? There were more paths than one beneath
the beech-tree. Which was the right one?
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Pedraglio swore at the absent Franco for not having
accompanied them, but the lawyer was studying
the Colmaregia, which could be climbed without
entering the forest. He had twice made the
ascent of the Colmaregia, that superb, slender,
grass-grown peak of the Boglia, which the line
of the frontier cuts in halves. He knew that
from there they would be able to descend to the
Swiss village of Brè, and he resolved to try that
route. No one was visible on the crest that rises
from the Madonnina beech towards the Colmaregia,
and the summit was enveloped in clouds.</p>

<p>Just below the beech-tree they were overtaken
by a wave of mist which had rolled up one side of
the mountain and was rapidly pouring down
the other; a cold, thick mist, a mist "as bad as
they make them," so V. said. They could not
see five steps ahead, and thus it happened that
near the beech-tree Pedraglio ran almost into the
arms of a customs-guard.</p>

<p>He was one of the four, and had been told off
to guard the open space between the brow of the
hill and the forest. Catching sight of the little
man in the top-hat, he exclaimed: "On the
Boglia, Sig&mdash;&mdash;" The lawyer quickly cast aside his
<i>gerla</i>, and the guard did not finish his sentence,
but stared a moment, open-mouthed, and then
exclaimed: "How is this?"</p>

<p>The lawyer did not wait for further
explanations.</p>

<p>"This is how it is," said he calmly, and drawing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
his fists into position on his breast, he hit out
suddenly, and dealt the guard a tremendous blow
in the stomach that sent him rolling on the grass,
his heels in the air. In a flash Pedraglio was
upon him, and snatched his carbine from him.</p>

<p>"If you yell, you dog, I shall do for you!" said
he. But how could he possibly yell? With a
blow like that in the stomach, it was all he could
do to breathe for at least fifteen minutes. In fact
the man lay like one dead, and it was some time
before they could even make him groan faintly:
"Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!"</p>

<p>"It's nothing, nothing at all," V. told him
with his usual, mocking calm. "Shocks like that
are good for the health. You will see. Now, my
friend, you are just going to pick yourself up and
stand nice and firm on your legs, and accompany
us to Colmaregia. You will see how well you will
be able to walk. I was careful not to use this."
And he showed him the key.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a blow!" groaned the guard. "Oh,
what a terrible blow!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed a rather stiff climb," the lawyer
went on, taking the carbine from Pedraglio, "but
with your permission we will help you up from
behind with the point of this instrument. Thus
climbing will become a delight. Then you must
bear us company down to Brè. We will carry
your carbine for you, but you, in return, must
carry this little <i>gerla</i>. Is my meaning quite clear
to you? Now, march!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
    But the wretched man could not get to his feet
and they certainly could not leave him there and
run the risk of his calling out for help.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Pedraglio. "You hit him
too hard."</p>

<p>V. replied that he had touched him with the
gentleness of a woman, and passing the carbine
to Pedraglio, he seized the guard by the collar of
his uniform, pulled him to his feet, and made him
run his arms through the straps of the <i>gerla</i>.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, you fraud!" said he. "March,
lazy-bones!"</p>

<p>Up, up, ever upwards they climbed through the
thick mist. The hillside was extremely steep,
and it was all they could do to find foothold between
the clumps of soft grass. They slipped,
they laboured with hands and feet, but they
heeded naught, struggling ever upwards for
freedom's sake. Up, up, ever upwards, through
the thick mist, invisible as spirits, first the false
Marianna, then the guard puffing and groaning
under the heavy <i>gerla</i>, then the false <i>Scior Zacomo</i>
promising him a fine view from the top, and from
time to time encouraging him with the point of
the carbine. The carbine worked miracles. In
half an hour the three had reached the crest, from
whence the hill slopes down towards Brè, lying
only a short distance below the summit. Then,
sitting upon the grass, they let themselves slide
rapidly downwards. Presently it began to rain,
and the mist grew thinner, and below them, at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
their feet, they could see the red of the woodlands.
<i>Scior Zacomo's</i> venerable top-hat was the first to
reach the spot, hurled from above by Pedraglio
with a joyful "Hurrah for Italy!" as he himself
slid onwards, arm in arm with the guard. At
Brè Pedraglio called the whole town together by
firing off the carbine in sign of exultation, and
then he distributed <i>anesone triduo</i> among the men,
and administered it in smaller doses to the girls.
He begged the curate to allow him to hang the
tail-coat in the church as a votive offering, sat
down to eat with the guard, got the priest to preach
him a sermon on the duty of pardoning blows in
the stomach, and read a verse of the monkish
poem to him, which ended thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At this point the good priest did exclaim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My views are no longer the same.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this he had no difficulty in demonstrating
to him that if this Padre Lanternone had suddenly
changed his opinions, he, the guard, would be
fully justified in changing his, and he finally
persuaded him to desert. The guard ended by
casting aside his uniform and donning the tail-coat,
amidst the laughter and applause of all
present. The only one who did not join in the
laughter was the lawyer. "What may not have
happened to poor Maironi?" said he.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Franco did not cross Castello. Upon reaching
the little Rovajà chapel he hastened downwards
by the path that leads to the fountain at Caslano,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
reached the narrow lane that goes to Casarico and
followed it upwards as far as the last turning just
below Castello, where the church of Puria becomes
visible beneath its amphitheatre of crags;
then he turned into the valley on the right, hastening
along a path fit for goats only, climbed upwards
once more below the church of Loggio, and
reached Villa Maironi without having met any
one.</p>

<p>Carlo, the old servant who opened the door for
him, nearly fainted with emotion as he kissed
Franco's hands. At that moment the doctor was
in the sick room. Franco decided to wait until he
should come out, and meanwhile took the faithful
old man into his confidence, telling that the gendarmes
were at his heels. Dr. Aliprandi soon came
out, and Franco, who knew him to be a patriot,
confided in him also, for he must show himself,
and make inquiries about his grandmother. Aliprandi
had been called in the night, after the
prefect had left for Oria. He had found the
Marchesa in a state of nervous excitement, tormented
by a terrible fear of death, but exhibiting
no symptoms of illness. At present she seemed
quite calm. Franco had her informed of his
arrival, and was ushered into the room by the
maid, who looked at him with obsequious curiosity,
and then withdrew.</p>

<p>The half-open shutters of the room where the
Marchesa lay, admitted only two slanting streaks
of grey light, which did not reach the face, thrown
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
back upon the pillow. On entering Franco
could not see that face, but he heard the familiar,
sleepy voice saying:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Franco?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmother. Good-morning," and he
stooped to kiss her. The waxen mask was unruffled,
but there was a vague and gloomy expression
about the eyes that seemed at once desire
and terror. "I am dying, you know, Franco,"
said the Marchesa. Franco protested, and repeated
what the doctor had said to him. His
grandmother listened, gazing eagerly at him, trying
to read in his eyes if the doctor had really
spoken thus. Then she answered:</p>

<p>"It makes no difference. I am quite ready."</p>

<p>From the changed expression on her face and
in her voice Franco understood perfectly that she
was quite ready to live twenty years longer. "I
am sorry for your bereavement," said she, "and I
forgive you."</p>

<p>Franco had not expected words of pardon from
her. He had believed it was for him to bring
forgiveness, not to receive it. Comforted and
reassured, the Marchesa of every day was gradually
reappearing beneath the Marchesa of an
hour. She was willing to purchase peace of mind,
but she was like the sordid miser who, having
yielded to the temptation of gratifying some
desire, allowed the price of his enjoyment to
escape painfully from between his tightly-clasped
fingers, trying the while to keep back as much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
as possible behind his nails. At another time
Franco's wrath would have burst forth, he would
have rejected that forgiveness angrily, but now,
with his sweet Maria in his heart, he could not feel
thus. He had however noticed that his grandmother
had proffered her forgiveness to him alone.
This was too much; he could not pass this over.</p>

<p>"My wife, my wife's uncle, and I myself have
suffered much beside this last bereavement,"
said he, "and now we have lost our only comfort.
Uncle Ribera I leave out of the question; you, I
myself, all must bow before him, but if my wife
and I have sinned against you, let us make forgiveness
mutual."</p>

<p>This was a bitter pill, but the Marchesa swallowed
it in silence. Although she no longer saw
death at her bedside, her heart still trembled with
the terror inspired by the apparition, and by
certain words the prefect had spoken on hearing
her confession. "I shall make a will," she said,
"and I wish you to know that the whole Maironi
property will go to you."</p>

<p>Ah, Marchesa, Marchesa! Poor, icy creature!
Did she believe she could purchase peace at this
price? In this the prefect also had blundered, for
it was he who had advised her to make this declaration
to her grandson, kind, honest man that
he was, but entirely without tact, and incapable
of understanding Franco's lofty soul. The idea
that she might think he had been prompted by
sordid motives to come to her, was intolerable to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
Franco. "No, no!" he exclaimed, quivering,
and fearing his hot temper would get the better
of him after all. "No, no! Don't leave me anything.
It will be quite enough if you will allow
the interest on my own money to be paid at Oria.
Grandmother, you must leave the Maironi property
to the Ospitale Maggiore. I fear my ancestors
did very wrong to keep it."</p>

<p>His grandmother had not time to answer, for
there came a knock at the door. The prefect
entered, and offering as an excuse that he would
tire the invalid, persuaded Franco to say good-bye.
"You must make haste," said he, when they
were outside. "You have done more than your
duty here. Too many people are now aware of
your presence, and the gendarmes may appear
at any moment. I have arranged everything
with Aliprandi. He considers a consultation
necessary for the Marchesa, and will take the
Villa Maironi gondola and go to Lugano for a
doctor. The two boatmen will be Carlo and yourself.
There are those oil-cloth cloaks with hoods.
Put on one of those and remain in the stern. Now
we must shave off that pointed beard of yours,
and then with the hood drawn over your head,
no one will possibly be able to recognise you.
You will be perfectly safe. Perhaps you may
not even be obliged to put in at the customs-house.
At any rate, they will not recognise you.
If there is any talking to be done, Carlo can do it."</p>

<p>The idea was good. The Marchesa's gondola
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
was always looked upon by the agents of Austria
with the greatest respect; as if it were carrying
an egg of the double-headed eagle. Even when
returning from Lugano it was made to stop at the
customs-house simply <i>pro forma</i>.</p>

<p>It was past eight o'clock when the gondola
left the boathouse. From the lofty summits the
mist had descended upon the lake, and it was
raining. Sad, sad day! Sad, sad journey!
Neither Franco, the servant, nor Aliprandi spoke
a word. They passed S. Mamette and Casarico,
and then, amidst the mist beyond the olives of
Mainè, the white walls of Maria's resting-place
appeared. Franco's eyes filled with tears. "No,
dear," he thought; "no, love; no, my life, you
are not there; and I thank my God, who tells me
not to believe this horrid thing!" A few strokes
more and there was the little house of happy days,
of bitter hours, of misfortune; there was the window
of the room where Luisa was giving herself
up to black grief, the loggia where, henceforth,
poor old Uncle Piero would spend his days alone,
that just man who was going down to the grave
in silence, in tribulation, in weariness. Franco
longed to know what had happened after his departure;
if the police had worried Uncle Piero
and Luisa. In vain he strained his eyes: no
living being was to be seen either on the terrace,
in the little garden, or at the windows of the
loggia. All was silent, all was calm. He stopped
rowing, searching for some sign of life. Dr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
Aliprandi opened the door of the <i>felze</i><a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> and
begged him to resume his rowing, begged him not
betray himself. At that moment Leu came to
the parapet of the little garden, with a jug in her
hand; she glanced at the gondola and then entered
the loggia. Uncle Piero must be in the
loggia, and they were taking him the customary
glass of milk, so probably nothing had happened.
Franco once more began to row, and Dr. Aliprandi
closed the door. They glided past the little garden,
past the other houses of Oria, and the gondola
turned towards the landing-stage of the
customs-house.</p>

<p>Bianconi, sitting under an umbrella and fishing
for tench, spied the gondola, and, dropping his
pole, came forward to pay his respects to the
Marchesa. But he found Dr. Aliprandi instead,
who so upset him by his alarming account of the
lady that he felt called upon to summon his
Peppina and impart the news to her; and Peppina,
poor woman, was obliged to act a little
comedy of affliction under her Carlascia's umbrella.
Both husband and wife exhorted Aliprandi
to make haste, to return quickly. The
big mastiff gave him permission to cross directly
from Gandria to Cressogno on the way back.
Then the doctor turned to Franco, and gave the
order to proceed. Franco had listened to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
conversation standing motionless, his hands clasping
his oar, and hoping to hear something about
his friends or his family. But no word was
breathed concerning either police, arrests, or
flights, and Casa Ribera might have been in
China. The gondola backed slowly away from the
landing-stage, turned its prow towards Gandria,
gliding ever further and further away until it had
slipped across the frontier, and vanished in the
mist.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On reaching the Lugano shore, Dr. Aliprandi
opened the door, and called Franco into the little
cabin. Their acquaintance was only slight, but
they embraced like brothers. "When the cannonading
begins I shall be there also," Aliprandi
said.</p>

<p>They must say good-bye here, and Franco must
go ashore first and alone, for Lugano was full
of spies and the doctor must also be cautious.
Besides, Aliprandi was in no hurry. He was
more anxious to find a boatman than a physician.
Franco drew his hood over his eyes, stepped ashore
and went directly to the Albergo della Corona.</p>

<p>Some hours later, when the gondola had started
homewards, he went out in search of some one
from Valsolda who might give him news, and
directed his steps towards the Fontana pharmacy.
Under the arcades he met his two friends, who
had just left the pharmacy. They fell upon his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
neck, and wept with emotion. They also had
been in search of news, and at the pharmacy they
had heard that Franco had been arrested. What
joy to find him here, and to feel they were standing
on free soil!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
THE SAGE SPEAKS</h2>

<p>No less than three springs had come and gone
since the autumn of 1855 without bringing
to the banks of the Ticino that mustering of armies
and of banners that the Italians had expected. In
February, 1859, all were convinced that a fourth
spring could not pass thus. Great events, duly
pre-announced by a splendid comet, were approaching.
The old world was quivering and
creaking inwardly, as does a frozen river on the
eve of a thaw. That deadly cold and awful silence
which had lasted ten years, was about to disappear,
to be swept away amidst the clamour of
strife and destruction, by new currents, warm
and brilliant. Carlascia was playing the braggart,
and would talk to his guards (who made no comments)
of an impending military expedition to
Turin. Signor Puttini had never entirely recovered
from the shock he had received on that
memorable morning; and the lawyer's treachery,
the tragic end of the top-hat, the comic end of the
tail-coat, had deeply affected him, and he had lost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
all respect for patriots. Dr. Aliprandi was already
in Piedmont. A veteran subaltern of the
army of Napoleon, who lived in Puria, was secretly
furbishing up his old uniform, with the intention
of presenting himself before the French Emperor
when he should enter Italy. Whenever Intrioni,
the curate of Castello, met Don Giuseppe Costabarbieri,
he would remind him of a certain rhyme
of 1796 which he, Don Giuseppe, had gone about
repeating in 1848, but which he had soon hidden
away again.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mighty Ulans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came here from Hungary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Frenchman's arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made them all promptly flee!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Don Giuseppe, greatly alarmed, would cry:
"Hush! Hush!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the violets continued to grow as
peacefully on the slopes of Valsolda as if nothing
were happening. On the evening of the twentieth
of February, Luisa carried a bunch to the cemetery.
She was still in mourning. Pallid and emaciated,
her eyes had become larger, and there were many
silver threads in her hair. She seemed to have
grown twenty years older since her bereavement.
Upon leaving the cemetery she turned towards
Albogasio, and joined some women from Oria,
who were going to recite the Rosary in the parish
church. She no longer seemed the same dark
phantom that had laid the violets on Maria's
grave. She talked calmly, almost gaily, first
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
with one, then with another of the women; inquired
after a sick animal, praised and caressed a
little girl who was going to the Rosary with her
grandmother, and told her to sit very still in
church, as her Maria had always done. She
said this and mentioned Maria very quietly, but
the women shuddered and were filled with astonishment,
for Luisa herself never went to church
now. She asked one of the girls if the young men
were going to act a play as usual, and if her brother
was to take part. Upon receiving an answer in
the affirmative she offered to help with the costumes.
She left the others on the church-place
of the Annunciata, and as she went down the
Calcinera alone her face once more resumed its
spectral appearance.</p>

<p>She was on her way to Casarico to see the Gilardonis,
who had been married three years. The
professor's happiness and his adoration of Ester
would deserve to be told in verse! Uncle Piero
said of him that he had grown feeble-minded.
Ester feared he might become ridiculous, and
would not allow him to assume certain ecstatic
poses before her when there was anyone present.
The only person in whose presence she did not
insist upon the observance of this rule was Luisa.
But Gilardoni always showed the greatest deference
for Luisa; to him she was still a superhuman
being; to his respect for the woman herself
had been added his respect for her grief, and in her
presence his behaviour was always most circumspect.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
Luisa had been going to Casa Gilardoni
almost every evening for about two years now,
and if anything could have troubled the couple's
happiness it would have been these visits.</p>

<p>Indeed, their motive was a strange one, and one
repugnant to Ester, but Ester's affection for her
friend, and her pity for her bereavement, were so
great, while her heart was so full of remorse for
not having looked after Maria more carefully on
that terrible day, that she did not dare to resolutely
oppose her wishes, or dissuade her husband
from gratifying them. She expressed her disapproval
to Luisa, and begged her at least to
maintain secrecy concerning the nightly doings in
the professor's study, but she went no further.
The professor, on the contrary, would have enjoyed
these séances had it not been for his wife's
disapproval. It was already dark when Luisa
rang the bell at the little door of Casa Gilardoni.
Ester herself opened it. Luisa did not return her
greeting, which she felt was full of embarrassment.
She simply looked at her, but when they
reached the little parlour on the ground-floor
where Ester was in the habit of spending her
evenings, she embraced her so passionately that
Ester burst into tears. "Have patience with me!"
Luisa said. "It is all that is left me!" Ester
tried to comfort her, telling her that happier times
were coming for her; that she and Franco would
soon be reunited. In a few months Lombardy
would be free, and Franco would come home.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
And then&mdash;and then&mdash;so many things might happen!
Perhaps Maria might return! Luisa started
violently and caught her friend's hands. "No!"
she cried. "Do not say such things! Never!
Never! I am all hers! I belong to Maria alone!"
Ester could not answer, for at that point the
smiling professor came bustling into the room.</p>

<p>He saw that his wife's eyes were wet with tears
and that Luisa was greatly excited. He greeted
her very quietly and sat down in silence beside
Ester, in the belief that they had been discussing
the usual subject, which was so painful to his wife.
She would have liked to send him away and resume
her conversation with Luisa, but did not
venture to do so. Luisa was shuddering at that
spectre of future danger which would sometimes
stand vaguely outlined before her mind's eye,
but which she had always banished with horror,
never pausing to examine it, and which now,
evoked by her friend's words, rose before her,
naked and distinct. After a long and painful
silence Ester sighed, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"You may go if you like. Go, both of you."</p>

<p>Luisa, moved by an impulse of gratitude, fell
on her knees before her friend and buried her face
in her lap. "You know," she said, "I no longer
believe in God. At first I thought there must be
a cruel God, but now I do not believe in the existence
of any God. But if a loving God, such as
He in whom you believe, did really, surely exist,
He would not condemn a poor mother who has
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
lost her only child, and who is struggling to persuade
herself that a part of that child still lives!"</p>

<p>Ester made no reply. Almost every night for
two years Luisa and her husband had evoked the
spirit of the dead child. Professor Gilardoni, in
whom there was a strange mingling of the free-thinker
and the mystic, had read with great interest
the marvellous tales that were told concerning
the Fox sisters&mdash;Americans&mdash;and the experiments
of Eliphas Levi, and had closely followed the
spiritualistic movement which had spread rapidly
in Europe, in the form of a mania that upset both
heads and tables. He had spoken to Luisa about
this movement, and Luisa, possessed and blinded
by the idea that she might ascertain if her child
did still exist, in which case she might in some
way be able to communicate with her, seeing
nothing else in all the marvellous facts and strange
theories save this one luminous point, had besought
him to make some experiments with Ester
and herself. Ester believed in nothing supernatural
outside the doctrines of Christianity, and
did not, therefore, take the matter seriously. She
willingly consented to place her hands on a small
table, in the company of her friend and her husband,
who, on the contrary, exhibited great zeal,
and had faith in their chances of success. The
first experiments were disappointing. Ester, who
found them tedious, would have liked to discontinue
the attempts, but one evening, after
twenty minutes of waiting, the little table tipped
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
to one side, lifted a leg in the air, righted itself,
and then tipped again, to Ester's great chagrin,
but to the great joy of Luisa and the professor.
The next night five minutes sufficed to make the
table move. The professor taught them the alphabet,
and then tried to summon a spirit. The table
responded, knocking with its leg upon the floor
according to the alphabet that had been arranged.
The spirit evoked gave its name: Van
Helmont. Ester was frightened and trembled
like a leaf; the professor was trembling also, but
with excitement. He wished to tell Van Helmont
that he had his works in his library, but Luisa
besought him to inquire where Maria was. Van
Helmont answered: "Near!" Then Ester rose,
as pale as a ghost, protesting that she would not
continue, and neither Luisa's tears nor entreaties
could move her. It was sinful, sinful! Ester's
religious sense was not deep, but she had a wholesome
fear of hell and the devil. For some time
it had been impossible to resume the séances&mdash;she
had a horror of them, and her husband did
not venture to oppose her wishes. It was Luisa
who, by dint of prayers and entreaties, at last
obtained a compromise. The séances were resumed,
but Ester took no part in them.</p>

<p>She did not even wish to know what took place.
Only, whenever her husband seemed worried or
preoccupied, she would throw out an uneasy
allusion to the secret dealings in the study. Then
he would be troubled, and offer to desist, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
Ester had not the courage to face Luisa. For
she had discovered indirectly that Luisa really
believed she held communication with the child's
spirit. Once she had said: "I shall not come
to-morrow night because Maria does not wish it."
At another time she had said: "I am going up
to Looch because Maria wants a flower from her
grandmother's grave." To Ester it seemed incredible
that a head so clear and strong could be thus
deluded. At the same time she realised the extreme
difficulty of convincing her by gentle means,
and all the cruelty of using harsh measures with
her.</p>

<p>The professor lit a candle and went upstairs to
the study, followed by Luisa. We are acquainted
with this study that was like a ship's cabin, its
shelves filled with books, its little fireplace, its
windows overlooking the lake and the armchair
in which Maria had gone to sleep one Christmas
Eve. The room now contained something else.
Between the fireplace and the window stood a
small round table, with one central leg only, that
branched out into three feet, about a hand's
breadth from the floor.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to cause Ester so much pain,"
said the professor as they entered the room. He
placed the light on the writing-desk, but instead
of preparing the little table and the chairs as usual
he went to look out of the window at the pale
light on the water and in the sky, amidst the
surrounding shadows of night. Luisa stood motionless,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
and suddenly he faced about as if some
magnetism had revealed her anguish to him.
He saw appalling anguish on her face, and understood
that she believed he had made up his mind
to stop the séances, whereas he had only been
tempted to do so, and, greatly moved, he seized
her hands, telling her that Ester was good, that
she loved her so much, that neither he nor she
would ever willingly cause her suffering. Luisa
did not answer, but the professor had all he could
do to prevent her kissing his hand. While he was
arranging the little table and the two chairs in the
centre of the floor, she sank into the armchair,
in a state of great depression.</p>

<p>"There!" said the professor.</p>

<p>Drawing a letter from her pocket Luisa handed
it to him.</p>

<p>"I need Maria and you so much to-night,"
said she. "Read that. It is from Franco. You
can begin with the fourth page." The professor
did not hear these last words, but going to the
light, began to read aloud:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="signature">"Turin, <i>February 18, 1859</i>.</div>

<p>"My <span class="smcap">own Luisa</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know you have not written to me for
a fortnight!"</p>

<p>"You can skip that," said Luisa, but at once
corrected herself. "No, perhaps you had better
read it." The professor continued.</p>

<p>"This is my third letter to you since yours of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
the sixth. Perhaps I was too violent in my first
letter, and wounded you. What a temper is this
of mine, that makes me speak, and sometimes
even write such harsh words when my blood is up!
And what blood is this of mine that at two-and-thirty
is as quick to boil as at two-and-twenty!
Forgive me, Luisa, and permit me to return to the
subject, and take back those words that may
have offended you.</p>

<p>"At present there is no more talk here either
of tables or of spirits, but only of diplomacy and
war; in former years, however, spiritualism was
very widely discussed, and several persons I both
respect and esteem believed in it. I knew positively
that many among them were simply deluded
but I never doubted their good faith when they
told me of conversations they had had with spirits.
It would indeed seem that our imagination, when
inflamed, can make us see and hear things that
do not really exist. But I am willing to admit
that in your case you are not deceived by your
imagination; that your little table does really move
and express itself exactly as you say. I was
wrong to doubt this&mdash;I confess it&mdash;in the first place
because you are so sure of not being mistaken, and
secondly, because I am well aware of Professor
Gilardoni's honesty. But to me this is a question
of sentiment. I know that my sweet Maria lives
with God, and I cherish the hope that some time
I, with other souls dear to me, may go where she
is. If she should appear before me unbidden, if,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
without having summoned her, I should hear the
sound of her voice, clear and distinct, perhaps
I should not be able to bear such joy. But I
could never summon her, never force her to come
to me. The thought is repugnant to me; it is
contrary to that sense of veneration I feel for a
Being who is so much nearer God than I am.
Dear Luisa, I also speak to our treasure every day,
speak to her of myself and of you as well; I am
convinced that she sees us, that she loves us, that
she can still do much for us even in this life. How
I wish that your intercourse with her might be of
the same nature! If, in answering your letter
in which you allude to a communication from her
I expressed myself too harshly, forgive me, not
only in consideration of my hasty temper, but still
more in consideration of my sentiments, which are
indeed a part of my nature.</p>

<p>"Forgive me also in consideration of the atmosphere
of intense excitement in which I am living
here. My throat is perfectly well. Since war
has been talked of, I have cast aside both camphor
and sedative waters, but my nerves are in a state
of such extraordinary tension that it seems as if,
were they touched, sparks must fly from them.
All this is partly due to the amount of work to be
accomplished at the Home Office, where it is no
longer a question of regular hours, but where
even the humblest secretary, if he be conscientious,
must strain every muscle. When I first
obtained this position through the kindness of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
Count Cavour, I felt I was not really earning the
bread the government gave me. This is no longer
the case, but I am about to withdraw from this
field of strenuous labour; and this brings me to
another topic, to something I have long had in my
heart, and which I now impart to you with feelings
of indescribable emotion.</p>

<p>"In a week my friends and I are going to enlist
in the army as volunteers, for the duration of the
coming campaign. We are entering the ninth
infantry regiment, stationed in Turin. Here at
the Home Office they would like to keep me some
time longer, but I intend to become familiar with
my duties in the regiment before the campaign
opens, and I have therefore simply promised not
to leave the Office until the day before we enlist.</p>

<p>"Luisa, we have not seen each other for three
years and almost five months! It is true you are
under police surveillance, and that you may not
go to Lugano, but I have several times proposed
means to you of meeting me, at least at the frontier,
or on the mountains, and you have never
even answered. I believed I knew why. It
was because you could not tear yourself away
even for a short time, from a certain sacred spot.
This seemed too much, and I confess I had many
bitter feelings. Then I reproached myself, I felt
I was selfish, and I forgave you. Now, Luisa,
circumstances have changed. I have no forebodings
of evil; indeed, it seems impossible that
I should be destined to end my days on a battlefield,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
nevertheless this is not impossible. I am
going to take part in a war that promises to be one
of the greatest, one of the longest and most desperate,
for if Austria is risking her Italian provinces,
we, and perhaps Emperor Napoleon as well, are
risking everything. It is said we shall spend
next winter beneath the walls of Verona. Luisa,
I cannot run the risk of dying without seeing you
once more. I shall have only twenty-four hours,
I cannot come to the frontier or to Lugano, and
I should not be satisfied to spend ten minutes with
you. Ask Ismaele to get you to Lugano in some
way on the morning of the twenty-fifth of this
month. Leave Lugano in time to reach Magadino
at one o'clock, for you cannot go by way of Luino.
At Magadino you must take the boat that leaves
at about half-past one. At four or thereabouts
you will reach Isola Bella, where I shall arrive at
about the same hour from Arona. At this time
of year Isola Bella is a desert. We can spend the
evening together, and in the morning you will
leave for Oria, I for Turin.</p>

<p>"I am writing to Uncle Piero to ask his forgiveness
for depriving him of your company for one day.</p>

<p>"I do not apprehend any danger. The Austrians
are thinking only of their arms, and their
police are letting thousands of young men escape
them, young men who come here to take up
arms. The Austrians would be terrible the day
after a victory, but, God willing! that day shall
never dawn for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
    "Luisa, can it be possible I shall not find you at
Isola Bella, that you may think you are pleasing
Maria by not coming? But don't you know that
if some one had said to my Maria, to my poor little
darling&mdash;run and say good-bye to your papa, who
is perhaps going away to die&mdash;how fast&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reader's voice trembled, broke, and was
lost in a sob. Luisa hid her face in her hands. He
placed the letter on her knees, saying with difficulty:
"Donna Luisa, can you hesitate?"</p>

<p>"I am wicked," Luisa murmured. "I am
mad!"</p>

<p>"But do you not love him?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I love him very much, at
other times not at all."</p>

<p>"My God!" the professor exclaimed. "But
now? Are you not moved by the thought that
you may never see him again?"</p>

<p>Luisa was silent, she seemed to be crying.
Suddenly she started to her feet, pressing her
hands to her temples, and fixed her eyes on the
professor's face, eyes in which there were no tears,
but in which there shone a sinister and angry
light. "You don't know," she cried, "what
there is here in my head! What a mass of contradictions,
how many opposite thoughts that
are struggling together, and always changing
places with each other! When I received the letter
I cried bitterly, and said to myself. 'Yes, my
poor Franco, this time I will go!'&mdash;And then there
came a voice that spoke here in my forehead, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
said: 'No, you must not go because&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>She ceased speaking, and the professor, terrified
by the flashes of madness he saw in those eyes
that were fixed on his, did not dare to ask for an
explanation. The eyes, which still stared into
his, gradually softened and became veiled with
tears. Luisa took his hands, and said gently,
timidly: "Let us ask Maria."</p>

<p>They sat down at the table and placed their
hands upon it. The professor sat with his back
to the light, which fell full upon Luisa's face. The
little table was in the shadow. After eleven minutes
of profound silence, the professor murmured:</p>

<p>"It is beginning to move."</p>

<p>In fact the table was gradually leaning over to
one side. Presently it righted itself, and knocked
once, lightly. Luisa's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the professor. "Answer
with the usual alphabet."</p>

<p>There came seventeen, then fourteen, then
eighteen knocks, and then one alone. "Rosa,"
said the professor softly. Rosa was a little sister
of his wife's who had died in infancy, and the
table had knocked out this name on several previous
occasions. "Go away," said Gilardoni.
"Send Maria to us."</p>

<p>The table soon began to move again, and
knocked out the words:</p>

<p>"It is I, Maria!"</p>

<p>"Maria, Maria, my own Maria!" whispered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
Luisa, her face assuming an expression of intense
joy.</p>

<p>"Do you know the contents of the letter your
father has written to your mother?" Gilardoni
inquired.</p>

<p>The table answered:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is your mother to do?"</p>

<p>Luisa was trembling from head to foot in anxious
suspense. The table did not move.</p>

<p>"Answer," said the professor.</p>

<p>This time the table moved, but knocked out
only an incomprehensible confusion of letters.</p>

<p>"We do not understand. Repeat."</p>

<p>The little table did not move again. "Repeat,
I tell you!" said the professor, rather
sharply.</p>

<p>"No, no!" begged Luisa. "Don't insist.
Maria does not wish to answer." But the professor
was bound to insist. "It is not admissible
that a spirit should not answer. You know very
well we have often before been unable to understand
what they said."</p>

<p>Luisa rose, greatly agitated, saying that rather
than force Maria she should prefer to cut the
séance short. The professor remained seated,
lost in thought. "Hush!" said he at last.</p>

<p>The table moved and once more began to
knock.</p>

<p>"Yes!" exclaimed Gilardoni, his face radiant.
"I inquired mentally if you should go, and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
table has answered 'yes.' Now you yourself
must ask aloud."</p>

<p>Five or six minutes passed before the table
began to move. In answer to Luisa's question:
"Shall I go?" there came first thirteen, then
fourteen knocks. The answer was "no."</p>

<p>The professor turned pale, and Luisa questioned
him with her eyes. He was silent for some time,
and then said with a sigh:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was not Maria. Perhaps it was
a lying spirit."</p>

<p>"And how can we find out?" Luisa inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>"We cannot find out. It is impossible."</p>

<p>"Then how about the other communications?
Is there never any certainty?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>She lapsed into terrified silence. Then presently
she murmured: "It was bound to end
thus. This also was to be taken from me."</p>

<p>She rested her forehead upon the table. The
candle light fell upon her hair, upon her arms and
hands. She was motionless, nothing moved in
the room save the little flickering flame of the
candle. Another little flame, the last light of
hope and of comfort, was dying out in this poor
head which had gone down before the onslaught
of a bitter and invincible doubt. What could
Gilardoni do or say? He saw that Ester's wish
would soon be gratified, but not by his means.
Three or four minutes later they heard Ester's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
voice, and steps on the floor below. Luisa
rose slowly.</p>

<p>"Let us go," said she.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we should pray," Gilardoni observed
without rising. "Perhaps we should ask the
spirits if they confess Christ."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" Luisa exclaimed in an undertone,
at the same time protesting with a hostile
gesture. The professor silently took up the
candle.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On her way back to Oria Luisa went up to the
gate of the cemetery. Resting her forehead
against it she sent a stifled good-bye towards
Maria's grave, then she went down the hill again.
On reaching the church-place she crossed over to
the parapet and gazed down upon the lake sleeping
in the shadow. She stood there some time,
letting her thoughts roam at will. Placing her
elbows on the parapet, she leaned forward and
rested her face upon her hands, still gazing at the
water, the water that had taken Maria. Her
thoughts were beginning to take a definite shape,
not within her, but down there in the water.
She contemplated this shape. To die, to end it
all! She was familiar with the thought, she had
seen it once before when gazing into the water
thus, long ago, before the experiments with the
professor began. After that it had disappeared.
But now it had returned again. It was a sweet
and merciful thought, full of rest, of self-surrender,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
and of peace. It was good to gaze upon it
now that her faith in the spirits was gone also.
To die, to end it all! On that former occasion the
image of her old uncle had been strong in helping
to dispel the fascination. Now it was not so
strong. Since Maria's death Uncle Piero had
lapsed into a state of almost complete silence
which Luisa believed to be the beginning of the
apathy of old age. She did not understand that
in the old man's soul profound disapproval was
mingled with grief, nor did she understand how
great was his aversion to these daily and repeated
visits to the cemetery, the flowers, the mysterious
journeys to Casarico, and above all, how he regretted
her complete abandonment of the church.
If she had not been so engrossed in her dead child
she might have understood her uncle better, at
least on this last point, the church, for now the
silent old man himself went to Mass oftener than
before, his heart returning to the religion of his
father and mother, which, heretofore, he had
practised coldly, from habit, and out of respect
for family traditions. It seemed to Luisa that he
had grown very dull, and that if only his personal
needs were attended to, he would be quite content.
Cia was there to attend to his comforts, and the
means that had sufficed for three would be more
than sufficient for two. Luisa thought she saw
the water rise a hand's breadth. And Franco?
Franco would be in despair, would mourn for a
few years, and then he would be happier than ever.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
Franco knew the secret of speedy consolation.
The water seemed to rise another hand's breadth.</p>

<p>At the same moment in which she had approached
the parapet, Franco, passing the church
of S. Francesco di Paolo in Via di Po, had seen
lights and heard the organ. He went in. Hardly
had he said a short prayer when the one dominant
thought took possession of him once more; the
sound of the organ became the noise of trumpets
and drums, the clash of arms; and while a hymn
of peace was rising from the altar, he, in imagination,
was furiously charging the enemy. Suddenly
he saw before his mind's eye the image of
Luisa, pale, and dressed in mourning. He began
to think of her, to pray for her with intense
fervour.</p>

<p>Then, standing there on the church-place of
Oria, she turned cold and was filled with dread,
while the tempting thought gradually vanished.
She tried to recall it, but could not. The water
subsided. An inward voice said to her: "What
if the professor be mistaken? What if it be not
true that the table answered first yes and then no?
what if it be not true about the lying spirits?"
She drew back from the parapet, and with slow
steps, went up to her house.</p>

<p>She found her uncle in the kitchen sitting in the
chimney-corner, the tongs in his hand, and his
glass of milk beside him. Cia and Leu were
sewing.</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Piero, "I have been to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
Custom-House. The Receiver is in bed with the
jaundice, but I spoke with the <i>Sedentario</i>."</p>

<p>"What about, uncle?"</p>

<p>"About Lugano. About your journey to Lugano
on the twenty-fifth. He has promised to
close an eye and let you pass."</p>

<p>Luisa was silent, and stood thoughtfully watching
the fire. Presently she gave Leu some orders
for the next day, and then begged her uncle to
come into the parlour with her.</p>

<p>"What for?" said he, with his habitual simplicity,
"You can't have any great secrets to tell.
Let us stay here where the fire is."</p>

<p>Cia lit a candle. "We will go out," said she.</p>

<p>The uncle made his usual grimace, expressive of
compassion for the weaknesses of others, but
remained silent. Draining his glass of milk, he
passed it to Luisa. She took the glass, and said
softly: "I have not decided yet."</p>

<p>"What?" the uncle exclaimed sharply. "What
is it you have not decided?"</p>

<p>"Whether I shall go to Isola Bella."</p>

<p>"Now what the deuce&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Uncle Piero was utterly incapable of grasping
such a thing as this.</p>

<p>"And why should you not go?"</p>

<p>She answered calmly, and as if stating a perfectly
obvious fact:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall not be able to leave Maria."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now!" Uncle Piero exclaimed.
"Sit down over there," and he pointed to a bench
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
in the chimney-corner opposite him. Then he
said, in that serious, honest voice of his, which
seemed to come from his heart:</p>

<p>"My dear Luisa, you have lost your bearings!"</p>

<p>And raising his arms, he uttered a long "Ah!"
and then let them fall upon his knees once more.</p>

<p>"Lost your bearings completely!" he repeated.
He sat silent for a time, his head bent, while
behind his pursed lips there was the rumbling of
words in course of formation, which presently
burst forth.</p>

<p>"I would never have believed it! It does not
seem possible! But when," and here he raised his
head and looked Luisa straight in the face, "but
when we once begin to lose our bearings it is all
up with us. And you, my dear, began to lose
yours a long time ago."</p>

<p>Luisa shuddered.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed!" Uncle Piero cried in a loud
voice. "You began losing yours a long time ago.
And now this is what I wish to say to you. Listen.
My mother lost children, your mother lost children,
I have seen many mothers lose children, but not
one of them acted as you act. What can you expect?
We are all mortal, and must adapt ourselves
to our circumstances. Other mothers become
resigned, but you do not. And this running two,
three, and even four times a day to the cemetery!
And the flowers, and I know not what all besides!
Oh, dear me! And all that foolishness at Casarico
with that other poor imbecile, which you think
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
is such a secret, while every one is talking of it,
even Cia. Oh, dear me!"</p>

<p>"No, uncle," said Luisa, sadly but calmly.
"Don't talk of these things. You cannot understand
them."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" the uncle retorted with all the
irony of which he was capable. "I cannot understand!
But there is something else. You no
longer go to church. I have never mentioned
this to you because I have always made it a rule
to let people do as they like, but when I see you
losing your good sense, losing your common-sense
even, the least I can do is to remind you that this
is all you do by turning your back on the Almighty.
And now this idea of not going to see your husband,
under similar circumstances! It is past
belief. Well, well," he said after a short pause,
"I will go myself."</p>

<p>"You?" Luisa exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why not? Yes, I. I had intended to accompany
you, but if you will not go I must take the
journey alone. I will go and tell your husband
that you have lost your head, and that I hope I
may soon be called to join poor Maria."</p>

<p>No one had ever heard such bitter words from
Uncle Piero's lips. Perhaps it was for that reason,
perhaps it was the authority of the man, perhaps
it was Maria's name pronounced in that way, but
at any rate Luisa was conquered.</p>

<p>"I will go," she said, "but you must stay here."</p>

<p>"Most certainly not!" cried Uncle Piero, greatly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
pleased. "It is forty years since I saw the islands.
I must avail myself of this opportunity. And
who knows but what I may enlist in the cavalry?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Well?" said Cia, when the uncle had gone to
bed. "Does my master really intend to go? For
the love of Heaven, don't let him, my dear!" And
she told Luisa that two hours before he had rolled
his eyes in a strange manner, letting his head sink
upon his breast, and when she had called to him
he had not answered. Presently he had recovered,
and had been provoked at her anxious questions,
protesting that he had not been ill, that he had
simply felt rather sleepy. Luisa listened to her,
standing with her candle in her hand, her eyes
glassy, and her attention divided between the
words she was hearing and another very different
thought, a thought very far removed from Uncle
Piero, from the house, from Valsolda.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
THE SUMMONS TO ARMS</h2>

<p>On the morning of the twenty-fifth of February,
the day fixed for their journey,
Uncle Piero rose at half-past seven, and went to
the window. A heavy, white fog hung over the
lake, hiding the mountains so that they appeared
only as short black streaks, one on the right, the
other on the left, between the lake and the fog.
"Alas!" the uncle sighed. He had not finished
dressing when Luisa came in, and using the unpleasant
weather as a pretext, once more begged
him to remain at home, and let her go alone. Cia
was greatly distressed, and had entreated her to
urge him not to go, for she knew he had had an
attack of giddiness on the twentieth, and that on
the twenty-second he had gone to confession without
mentioning it to any one. Seeing that he was
growing impatient, Luisa decided it would be
wiser to desist, and let him have his own way.
Poor Uncle Piero, he had always enjoyed the best
of health, and now he was extremely apprehensive,
and the slightest disturbance alarmed him. But
he did not feel that Luisa should be allowed to set
out alone in her present state of mind, and so he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
was going to sacrifice himself for her. He finished
dressing and returning to the window called out
triumphantly to Luisa, who was in the little
garden below.</p>

<p>"Look up!" said he. "Look up at the Boglia!"</p>

<p>High up above Oria through the smoking fog,
the pale gold of the sun shining on the mountain
could be seen, and still higher up all was clear and
transparent.</p>

<p>"Fair weather!"</p>

<p>Luisa did not reply, and the old man came down
to the loggia in a cheerful frame of mind, and went
out to the terrace to enjoy the magnificent
struggle between fog and sun.</p>

<p>The stretch of water towards the east between
the Ca Rotta, the last house of S. Mamette on the
left, and the gulf of the Doi on the right, was one
immense white sea. The Ca Rotta could just be
distinguished, coming out of the fog like some
spectre. At the gulf of the Doi, the narrow black
streak of the mountains began, making a gap
between the leaden lake and the fog, which, little
by little, was assuming a bluish hue. Vague
lights broke in the sky towards Osteno; at the end
of the eastern sea a new brightness trembled,
streaks and spots, dark with the breeze, were forming;
the eye of the sun appeared and disappeared
among the whirling clouds above Osteno, until at
last, growing rapidly larger, it shone forth triumphant.
The fog fled in all directions in sheets
and puffs, of which many sped past Oria, large
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
and swift, while others cast themselves upon the
shore; but the largest rolled away into the far
east, where, behind and above a heavy white
curtain, the mountains of the lake of Como rose,
glorious in the blue.</p>

<p>Uncle Piero called Luisa to witness the spectacle,
the last splendid scene of the drama, the triumph
of the sun, the flight of the mists, the glory of the
hills. He admired nature in a simple manner,
without the refinement of the artistic sense, but
with youthful ardour, and with the ring of sincerity
in his voice; his admiration was that of an old man
who has lived a life of purity, who has not exhausted
the freshness of his spirit, who still retains
a certain simplicity of imagination. "Look,
Luisa!" he exclaimed, "we must indeed cry out,
'Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost!'" Luisa did not answer, but went quickly
indoors, that she might not see that white enclosure
beyond the kitchen-garden that was
drawing her so strongly, with its tacit cry of
reproach and grief. She had gone there that
morning at six o'clock, and had remained an hour,
seated on the wet grass.</p>

<p>The uncle remained on the terrace lost in contemplation
until the moment of departure arrived.
Had he been a vain poet he might have imagined
that Valsolda was offering him this farewell spectacle
to speed him on his way; that she wished to
show herself more beautiful than he had, perhaps,
ever seen her before. However, these poetic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
fancies did not come to him, and, besides, his
journey was to be so short. But the image of
Maria came to him instead; he saw her running
round him, he took her upon his knee, and repeated
the old rhyme to her:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proud shade of the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Missipipì&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Enough!" he sighed. "It was a terrible
thing!" and in answer to a summons from Cia he
went slowly towards the little garden where Luisa
was awaiting him, ready to go down to the boat.
"Here I am," said he. "And you, Cia, be careful
not to let the house tumble into the lake while we
are away!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>During the journey on Lake Maggiore on board
the <i>San Bernardino</i>, Luisa remained in the second-class
cabin most of the time. She went on deck
once to try and persuade Uncle Piero to go below
also, but, although the wind was cold, Uncle Piero,
wrapped in his heavy grey travelling cloak, would
not stir from the deck, where he sat calmly watching
the hills and villages, and chatting with a priest
from Locarno, with a little old woman from Belgirate,
and with other second-class passengers.
Luisa was obliged to leave him there, while she
herself went below again, preferring to be alone
with her own thoughts. As they approached Isola
Bella a sense of inward excitement and a vague
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
foreboding of many things took possession of her.
How would the meeting with Franco take place?
How would he treat her? Would he repeat Uncle
Piero's sermon to her? His letters were indeed
always compassionate and tender, but who does
not know that we write in one way and speak in
another? How and where would they spend the
evening? And then that other question, that
question it so terrified her to think about&mdash;&mdash;?
All these anxious thoughts were rising higher and
higher, threatening to become dominant, to place
themselves in bold opposition to that image of
the cemetery of Oria, which from time to time
would return with impetuous violence, as if to
snatch back its own. At the station of Cannero,
Luisa heard the noise of many steps and of loud
talking above her head, and went upstairs to look
after her uncle. A party of soldiers, recalled to
service, had come out to the steamer in two large
barges. Other small boats bore women, children,
and old men, who were crying and waving good-bye.
The soldiers, most of whom were <i>Bersaglieri</i>,
fine jolly young fellows, answered the greeting
with shouts of "Hurrah for Italy!" and made
promises of presents from Milan. One old woman,
all dishevelled, but tearless, had three sons among
those soldiers, and was calling out to them to
remember our Lord and the Madonna. "Yes,
yes," grumbled an old sergeant who was escorting
them, "Remember our Lord, and the Madonna,
and the Bishop, and don't forget the <i>prevosto</i>, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
parish priest!" The soldiers, who were well acquainted
with the <i>prevosto</i>, or military prison,
laughed loudly at the joke, as the steamer started
forward. There were cries, and waving of handkerchiefs,
and then the men burst into song, a
song shouted by fifty strong voices.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Addio, mia bella, addio,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">L'armata se ne va.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The soldiers were all clustered together at the
prow, among piles of bags and barrels, some sitting,
some lying down, others standing, and all singing
at the top of their voices to the dull accompaniment
of the paddles as the steamer glided straight
towards that background of sky, against which
rose the pointed hills of Ispra, dividing the immense
expanse of water from the Ticino beyond.
The young men would soon be crossing the Ticino,
probably to the cry of "Savoy for ever!" and
amidst the fury of cannonading. Death was
awaiting many of them down there under that
clear sky, but all sang gaily, and only the dull noise
of the paddles seemed to be aware of their fate.
The free hills of Piedmont, past which the boat
was gliding, although they stood in the shadow,
seemed to shine with pride and satisfaction at
having given their sons to the captive hills of
Lombardy, which wore an air of tragedy, although
illumined by the sun. Luisa felt her blood begin
to tingle, felt her once ardent patriotism begin to
stir. And those mothers who had seen their sons
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
depart thus? She foresaw whither her thoughts
were tending, and hastened to assure herself that
she also would gladly have given a son to Italy,
that the grief of those mothers could not in any
way be compared to hers. But what a difference
there was between reading a letter in Valsolda,
telling of the war, and feeling the very breath,
hearing the very noise of war all about her, feeling
it in the air itself! In the quiet of Valsolda, war
was a shadow without substance; here the shadow
became incarnate. Here Luisa's personal grief,
that immense grief which filled the lifeless air
surrounding her in Oria, seemed to shrink before
the emotion of many, and her consciousness of
this gave her an indefinable sense of discomfort
and trouble. Was it the dread of losing a part of
her own grief, a part, as it were, of herself? Was
it the desire to escape from a comparison from
which she shrank? At the same time the idea that
Franco was going to this war, the idea that had
affected her so slightly in Valsolda, was now assuming
a new aspect of reality in her mind, was
making her heart quiver, and it also was wrestling
with the image of the cemetery of Oria. For the
first time this image of the past was no longer the
one, all-powerful master of her soul, and although
her soul was indignant and regretful, new images,
images of the present and of the future, were
assailing it.</p>

<p>Uncle Piero began to feel cold and came down to
the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
    "In little more than an hour we shall be at Isola
Bella," said he.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I feel wonderfully well."</p>

<p>"But nevertheless, you will go to bed early
to-night?"</p>

<p>The uncle, whose thoughts were wandering, did
not answer, but presently he exclaimed: "Do
you know what I was thinking? I was thinking
that now there ought to be another Maria."</p>

<p>Luisa, who was sitting beside him, sprang up
shuddering, and went to the little window opposite,
standing with her back to Uncle Piero, who did
not understand in the least, and, concluding she
was embarrassed, went to sleep in his corner.
The steamer touched at Intra. Now there was
only Pallanza before Isola. They were skirting
the coast; through the little oval window Luisa
could see the banks, the houses, the trees slipping
by. How fast the boat was gliding, how
fast!</p>

<p>Pallanza. The steamer stopped five minutes.</p>

<p>Luisa went on deck and inquired when they
would reach Isola Bella. They would not stop
either at Suna or Baveno, so it was a question of
only a few minutes now. And when would the
steamer from Arona arrive? The steamer from
Arona appeared to be late. She went below once
more to awaken Uncle Piero, who presently came
on deck with her. The last part of the journey
was accomplished in silence. The uncle watched
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
Pallanza, which they were leaving behind, while
Luisa had fixed her gaze on Isola Bella, which
they were rapidly approaching, and she saw nothing
else.</p>

<p>The boat reached the landing-stage at Isola
Bella at forty minutes past three. There was no
sign of the steamer from Arona. A porter told
Luisa that it was always late now because the train
from Novara was never on time, owing to the
movement of troops. No one else went ashore at
Isola, no one was on the beach save the attendant
at the landing-stage. When the boat had left, he
himself conducted the two travellers to the <i>Albergo
del Delfino</i>. He said it was a mere chance their
finding the hotel open at this season. A large
family were spending the winter there. They were
English people. Indeed, it seemed the Island of
Silence. The lake lay about it, motionless and
silent, the shore was deserted, no living being
was to be seen in the porches of the poor little
houses clustered together about the bay, between
one of the round bastions of the gardens and the
hotel. The English people had gone out in a boat;
the hotel was as silent as the shore and the water.
The new arrivals were given two large rooms on
the second floor, both of which faced south, and
overlooked the melancholy strait between the
island and the wooded strip of coast that runs from
Stressa to Baveno. The first room was on the
western corner of the house, and its window looked
out on the little church of S. Vittore, which rises
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
beside the hotel, and upon the small Isola dei
Pescatori in the distance. Uncle Piero planted
himself at the window contemplating the little
island, the little pile of houses rising out of the
mirror of the lake and culminating in a campanile;
the great mountains of Val di Toce and Val di
Gravellone, half hidden in a thin mist through
which the sun was shining. Luisa, seeing that the
room contained two beds, hastened to the other
room, where an alcove also held two beds.
"There," said Uncle Piero, coming in, a moment
later, "this will do nicely for you two." Luisa
asked the proprietor, in an undertone, if they
could not have three rooms instead of two. No,
it was impossible. "But this is all right," Uncle
Piero repeated. "This is a perfect arrangement.
You take this room, and I will have the other."
Luisa was silent, and the proprietor withdrew.
"Don't you see you have an alcove, just as at
home?" It never struck the simple old man that
the very sight of that alcove was a torment to
Luisa. She told him she preferred the other
room, which was lighter and more cheerful.
"Amen!" said the uncle. "Do as you like. I
am quite willing to be alcoved."</p>

<p>This corner of the hotel soon lapsed into silence
once more. Luisa posted herself at the window.
The boat from Arona must be very near now; the
man who had accompanied them to the hotel was
walking slowly towards the landing-stage, and in
a few minutes she heard the noise of the paddles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
in the distance. Uncle Piero told Luisa he was
tired, and remained in his room.</p>

<p>She went down towards the landing-stage and
stopped behind a small house that hid the boat
from view, but she could hear it distinctly. Suddenly
the prow of the <i>San Gottardo</i> glided slowly
in front of her and stopped. Luisa recognised her
husband in the midst of a noisy group. Franco
saw her, and springing ashore, ran towards her,
while she came forward a few steps to meet him.
They embraced, he speechless and blind with
emotion, laughing and crying, full of gratitude,
but uncertain as to her state of mind, as to how he
should regulate his conduct; she more composed,
extremely pale, and serious. "God bless you!
God bless you!" he kept repeating, as they turned
towards the hotel. Then Franco overwhelmed
her with questions, first about her journey and
the passing of the frontier, and then about Uncle
Piero. When he mentioned the uncle, Luisa
raised her head and said: "Look!" The old man
was at the window waving his handkerchief and
calling out his welcome in a ringing voice. "Oh!"
cried Franco in amazement, and he ran forward.</p>

<p>Uncle Piero was waiting for him on the landing,
his face wearing an expression of satisfaction that
seemed to spread all over his peaceful breast.
"How are you, my boy?" said he, taking both
his hands and shaking them heartily, but, nevertheless,
holding him at a distance. He did not
want kisses, feeling that at such a moment they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
would mean thanks; but he could not hold out
against Franco's impetuosity. "Did you fancy
a lady of the house of Maironi could travel without
a courier?" said he, when he had extricated
himself from the young man's arms. "Moreover,
I came to enlist in the <i>Bersaglieri</i>!" And the
man who had said he was tired started downstairs,
saying he was going to order dinner.</p>

<p>There was no sofa in their room. Franco drew
Luisa to a seat on the bed, and sat down beside
her, encircling her shoulders with his arm. He
could not talk to her, could only keep on repeating:
"I thank you! I thank you!" as he lavished
eager caresses, eager kisses, and tender names
upon her. Luisa did not respond in any way,
but trembled violently with bowed head. Presently
he checked himself, and, taking her head
in his hands like some sacred thing, fell to touching
with his lips the white hairs he saw here and
there. She knew he was searching out the white
hairs, understood those timid kisses, and was
moved. She felt her heart of ice melting, and,
seized with terror, struggled to defend herself
more against her own emotions than against
Franco. "You don't know," she said, "how
cold my heart is. I did not even want to come,
did not want to leave Maria or give you the pain of
finding me in this state. But I came on Uncle
Piero's account. He was determined to set out
alone, and that I could not allow."</p>

<p>When she had pronounced these cruel words she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
felt Franco's lips withdrawn from her hair, felt
his arm forsake her shoulders. Both were silent
for a time, then Franco murmured with great
gentleness:</p>

<p>"Only thirteen hours more. Then perhaps I
shall never trouble you again." At that moment
Uncle Piero entered and announced that dinner
was ready. Luisa took her husband's hand and
pressed it in silence; it was not a lover-like pressure,
but it told him she shared his emotion.</p>

<p>At dinner neither Franco nor Luisa could eat.
But the uncle had a good appetite, and talked a
great deal. He did not approve of Franco's
enlisting. "What sort of a soldier do you expect
to become?" said he. "What will you do
without your camphor, your sedative water, and
all the rest?"</p>

<p>Franco replied that he had cast aside all remedies,
that he felt as if he were of steel, and that he
should become the most robust soldier of the whole
ninth regiment. "Maybe," the uncle grumbled,
"maybe. And you, Luisa, what do you say
about it?" Luisa believed it would be as her
husband had said. "Then that is enough!"
the uncle cried. "And so, hurrah!" He had
a great opinion of the strength of Austria, and did
not view matters in the same rosy light as did
Franco. According to Franco there was not the
slightest doubt that the Italians would be victorious.
He had seen one of Niel's adjutants,
who had come to Turin on a secret mission, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
had heard him say to some staff officers: "<i>Nous
allons supprimer l'Autriche!</i>" Of course they
fully expected to leave at least fifty thousand
Italians and Frenchmen between the Ticino and
the Isonzo.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Signori," said the waiter who was
serving them, "but did the gentlemen speak of
enlisting in the ninth regiment?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The Queen's Brigade! A splendid brigade!
I served in the tenth. We covered ourselves with
glory in 1848, as you may remember. Goito,
Santo Lucia, Governolo, and Volta. Now it will
be your turn."</p>

<p>"We will do our best."</p>

<p>Luisa shuddered slightly. The English people,
who were dining at a table near them, heard this
dialogue and looked at Franco. For some minutes
no one in the room spoke; there passed before
them the vision of a column of infantry charging
with fixed bayonets, amidst a shower of grapeshot.</p>

<p>After dinner the uncle remained at the hotel
for his usual nap, and Franco went out with Luisa.
They turned to the right towards the Palace.
It was rather dark and a few infrequent drops of
rain were falling. The steps leading from the
shore to the courtyard of the villa were slippery,
and Franco offered his arm to his wife, who took it
in silence. They stopped between the deserted
courtyard and the stairs that lead to the landing-stage,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
to count the hours which the clock on the
Palace was ringing out. Six o'clock. Two hours
had passed, and there now remained only eleven
before the separation, before the unknown! They
walked on slowly and silently, following the
straight path between the lake and the side of
the Palace, as far as the corner which commands
a view of the Isola dei Pescatori, where some
lights were already visible. Two women came
towards them, chattering, and walking arm in
arm. Franco allowed them to pass, and then
asked his wife if she remembered the Rancò.</p>

<p>Two years before their marriage they had made
an excursion with a party of friends to Drano
and the Rancò, high pasture-lands of the Valsolda,
on the way to the Passo Stretto. They had had a
lively dispute, and had sulked and suffered for an
hour. "Yes," Luisa replied, "I remember."
At the same moment both realised how different
was the present hour, and how painful it was to
have to admit the difference. They did not
speak again until they reached the corner. Bells
rang out on the Isola dei Pescatori. Franco
dropped his wife's arm, and leaned upon the parapet.
The misty lake was silent; nothing was to
be seen save the lights on the other island. The
lake, the mist, those lights, those bells, which
might have belonged to a ship lost at sea, the
silence of all things, even the infrequent, tiny rain-drops,
everything was so sad!</p>

<p>"And do you remember afterwards?" Franco
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
murmured, without turning his head. Luisa was
also leaning against the parapet. She was silent
for a moment, and then answered in an undertone:</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>And in her "dear," there was a slight and hidden
beginning of warmth, of affectionate emotion.
Franco felt it, and thrilled with joy, but controlled
himself.</p>

<p>"I am thinking," he went on, "of the letter I
wrote you as soon as I got home, and of the three
words you said to me next day, at Muzzaglio,
when the others were dancing under the chestnut-trees,
and you passed close to me on your way to
get your shawl, which you had left on the grass.
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He took her hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>"And do you also remember that I slipped
before we reached the bridge, and that you said:
'My dear sir, it is your place to support me!'"</p>

<p>Luisa did not answer, but pressed his hands.</p>

<p>"I have been good for nothing," he added
sadly. "I have not known how to support you."</p>

<p>"You have done all you could."</p>

<p>Luisa's voice, as she spoke these words, was
indeed faint, but very different from when she
had said: "My heart is so cold."</p>

<p>Once more her husband drew her arm through
his, and they returned to the landing-stage. The
dear arm was less passive than before, and betrayed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
agitation and a struggle. Franco stopped,
and said softly:</p>

<p>"And if I am called to join Maria? What shall
I say to her from you?"</p>

<p>She began to tremble, and resting her head on
his shoulder, whispered: "No, stay here!"
Franco did not hear the words, and repeated:
"What?" There was no answer, and very
slowly he bent his head towards her, saw her lips
seeking his, and pressed his own upon them. His
heart was beating fast, faster than when he had
kissed Luisa for the first time as her lover. He
raised his head, but could not speak. At last he
succeeded in saying these words: "I will tell
her you have promised&mdash;&mdash;" "No," murmured
Luisa, in great distress. "I cannot do
that. You must not ask it of me! It is no
longer possible!"</p>

<p>"What is not possible?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you understand quite well! I also understood
what you meant!"</p>

<p>She started forward as if to flee from the subject,
but still clinging to Franco's arm, and he
held her back.</p>

<p>"Luisa," said he gravely, almost severely, "will
you let me go away like this? Do you realise
what it means to me to go away like this?"</p>

<p>Then she slowly withdrew her arm from his,
and turned towards the parapet on the right,
leaning upon it, and gazing into the water as she
had done that night at Oria. Franco stood
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
quietly beside her; waited a few moments, and
then begged her to answer his question.</p>

<p>"It would be better for me to end it all in the
lake," she said bitterly. Her husband passed
his arm round her waist, pulled her away from
the parapet, and then letting her go, threw up his
arm with a gesture of protest. "You!" said he
indignantly. "You talk thus? You who used
to prate of looking upon life as a battle? And
is this the way you fight? Once I believed you
were the stronger of us two. Now I know it is I
who am the stronger. Much the stronger! Can
you not even imagine what I have suffered during
all these years? Can you not&mdash;&mdash;" For a
moment his voice failed him, but he quickly controlled
himself and went on. "Can you not even
understand what you are to me, and what I
would give to be able to spare you the slightest
pain? While you, it would seem, do not care how
cruelly you rend my soul!" She flung herself
into his arms. In the silence that ensued,
broken only by her spasmodic and suppressed
sobbing, Franco heard steps approaching, and
with difficulty freed himself from her embrace and
induced her to turn with him towards the hotel.
"You naughty girl!" he whispered. "And it is
you who don't want me to be glad to die, when
I can die so gloriously for my country!" Luisa
pressed his arm without speaking. They met
two young lovers, who looked curiously at them
in passing. The girl smiled. When they reached
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
the short flight of steps that leads down to the little
square in front of S. Vittore, they heard voices
of women and girls. Luisa paused a moment on
the first step, and said softly the three words she
had spoken at Muzzaglio.</p>

<p>"I love you!"</p>

<p>Franco did not answer, but pressed her arm.
Very slowly they went down the stairs, and entered
the Albergo del Delfino.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some young men who were drinking, smoking,
and laughing, rose as Franco and Luisa entered,
and came towards them. "Signora," said the
first to present himself to Luisa, "your husband
has probably announced to you the visit of the
Seven Wise Men." A great hubbub immediately
ensued, because Franco had forgotten to tell
Luisa that his friends had accompanied him from
Turin, but, not wishing to intrude, had gone on to
Pallanza promising to come and pay their respects
to the Signora in the evening. They had come
over from Pallanza in a row-boat, and had intended
returning immediately, but Franco ordered
a couple of bottles of wine and, soon, in spite of
Luisa's presence, their hilarity became such that
the proprietor begged them, for love of his
English family, to make less noise.</p>

<p>After arranging with Franco to meet him in the
morning on board the first steamer, the Wise Men
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
took themselves off. Franco accompanied them
to the boat and Luisa went to look after Uncle
Piero. He had left word for them with the proprietor
that, feeling very sleepy, he had gone to
bed. In fact Luisa could hear him snoring noisily.
She put the candle down, and waited for
Franco.</p>

<p>He came up almost immediately, and was surprised
to hear that the uncle was already asleep.
He had wished to say good-bye to him before
going to bed, as his boat was leaving so early in
the morning&mdash;at half-past five. The door between
the two rooms was closed, but nevertheless
Luisa begged her husband to step and speak
softly. She told him what Cia had confided to
her. The uncle needed rest. She hoped he
would remain in bed until nine or ten o'clock,
and she intended to start at one, and spend the
night at Magadino, in order not to tire him too
much. She laid great stress upon her apprehensions
concerning Uncle Piero's health, and
talked incessantly, nervously, anxious to avoid
other topics, seeking thus to escape too tender
caresses. At the same time she was continually
moving about the room, repeatedly taking up and
putting down the same objects, and this partly
from nervousness, partly with the intention that
her husband should go to bed before her. He,
for his part, was intent upon a side-bag, which
he was finding difficulty in opening. At last he
succeeded, and, calling his wife to him, gave her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
a roll containing fifty twenty-franc pieces. "I
know," said he, "that I shall not be able to send
you anything for some months. This money is
not mine, I have borrowed it." Then he drew
a sealed letter from his pocket. "And this,"
he added, "is my will. I have little to leave, but
of course I must dispose of that little. I have
made only one legacy. My father's scarf-pin,
which you have, is to go to Uncle Piero. I have
also set down the name of the person who loaned
me the thousand francs. Besides the will the
letter contains a few words for you alone. That
is all." He spoke with grave sweetness, and
without agitation. Her hands trembled as she
took the letter. "Thank you," she said, and
began to unbraid her hair, but she immediately
twisted it up again, hardly conscious of what she
was doing, in her struggle with the phantom of
the dead child, and with another vision of war
and death. She said brokenly that, as she must
be up so early to accompany Franco to the boat,
she thought she would lie down with her clothes
on, and not loosen her hair. Franco made no
comment, but having said a short prayer, began
to undress. From his neck he unclasped a little
chain from which hung a small gold cross. This
had belonged to his mother. "I wish you to
keep this," said he, offering it to Luisa. "It will
be safer. It might, perhaps, fall into the hands
of the Croatians." She was horrified, she shuddered,
hesitated a moment, then threw her arms about
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
his neck, and pressed him to her in a passionate
embrace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The waiter knocked at their door at about half-past
four. At five Franco took the candle and
went into Uncle Piero's room. He was already
awake. Franco said good-bye to him, and then
proposed to Luisa that they also take leave of each
other in the privacy of their own room. In her
face and voice there was an expression of grave
and painful stupor. She displayed no agitation,
and did not weep, but embraced and kissed her
husband as one in a dream, and, still in a dazed
state, followed him downstairs. Did a flash from
the thought that was filling her soul pass into his?
If so, it happened in the little hotel parlour, while
he was taking his coffee, his wife seated opposite
him. He seemed suddenly to discover something
in that glance, in that expression, for he paused to
study her, cup in hand, while ineffable tenderness,
anxiety and emotion overspread his face. She
evidently had no wish to speak, but he longed to
do so. A hidden word quivered in all the muscles
of his face, and shone in his eyes, but his mouth
did not venture to utter it.</p>

<p>Hand in hand they went down to the landing-stage,
and leaned against the wall where Luisa
had leaned the day before. When they heard the
noise of the paddles, they embraced for the
last time and said good-bye without tears,
troubled rather by the hidden thought harboured
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
by both than afflicted by the separation. The
steamer came in noisily, the ropes were flung
ashore and made fast. A bell rang. One kiss
more! "God bless you!" said Franco, and hurried
on board.</p>

<p>She lingered as long as she could hear the noise
of the paddles, as the steamer glided towards
Stressa. Then she returned to the hotel, sank
upon the bed, and sat there as one turned to stone,
engrossed in the idea, in the instinctive certainty,
that maternity awaited her a second time.</p>

<p>Although this was precisely what she had so
greatly feared it cannot be said that now she was
grieved. All other sentiments were subdued by
the wonder of listening to a strong, inward voice,
that was so clear and still so inexplicable. She
was dazed. Since Maria's death she had firmly
believed that the Book of Destiny could contain
nothing new for her, that certain secret fibres of
her heart were dead. And now a mysterious voice
was speaking within that heart, saying: Know
that one page in the book of your destiny
is finished, and the leaf has been turned. For
you there is still a future of intense living. The
drama that you believed had come to an end at
the second act, is to continue, and if I Myself announce
it to you, it must indeed prove wonderful!</p>

<p>For three hours, until Uncle Piero called her,
she sat there, absorbed in this voice.</p>

<p>The uncle rose at half-past nine; he was feeling
very well. The weather was still damp, almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
rainy, but he would not hear of remaining in the
house until it was time to start for Magadino, as
Luisa wished him to do. He knew, for he had
inquired of the proprietor, that the gardens could
be visited after nine o'clock, so at ten he drank his
milk and then started out to visit them with Luisa.
When they passed S. Vittore he wished to go in
and see the paintings. Mass was being sung, and
at that moment the officiating priest turned towards
them and said <i>Benedicat vos omnipotens
Deus</i>. Uncle Piero crossed himself devoutly,
and lingered to hear the last gospel. He did not
attempt to examine the paintings, for there was
little light in the church, but said with his accustomed
cheerfulness: "Now that I have received
that blessing I feel quite happy!"</p>

<p>It was not possible to hurry in his company.
He stopped at every step, examining everything
that seemed artistic, everything that was in a
position to be examined. He studied the front
of the church, the triple stairway of the landing-stage
of Villa Borromeo, all three sides of the courtyard,
and the great palm in the centre, which he
was much scandalised to learn Luisa had not
even noticed when she had passed it the night
before with Franco. When the custodian ushered
them into the palace, it took the uncle at least
ten minutes to climb and admire the great stairway.
As they reached the top a ray of sun glinted
forth, and the custodian proposed that they
should take advantage of this and visit the gardens.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
He turned to the left and led the visitors
through a suite of empty rooms to the iron gate,
where he rang the bell. A gardener appeared,
a civil lad, to whom Uncle Piero took a great fancy,
for he explained everything willingly, and the
uncle's questions were not few. The camphor-tree
near the entrance cost him five minutes.
Luisa was distressed, for she feared the uncle
would tire himself too much, and she herself was
weary of looking at so many trees, of hearing so
many names, both Latin and Italian, and of having
to watch the uncle, while her thoughts called
for silence and solitude. The gardener proposed
going up to the Castello di Nettuno. Uncle Piero
would have liked to inspect more closely the
unicorn of the Borromei, which stood rampant
up there, but there were many stairs to climb,
the air was heavy, and he hesitated. Luisa took
advantage of that moment of hesitation to ask the
gardener where she might find a seat. "Just
below here," said he. "On the left, where the
<i>Strobus</i> are." Uncle Piero finally consented to go
down and visit the clump of <i>Strobus</i>.</p>

<p>He was tired, but he continued to look at everything,
to ask questions about everything. As
they walked towards the <i>Strobus</i> they heard in
the distance, over towards Isola Madre, the rolling
of the drums of the National Guard of Pallanza,
which was drilling on the shore. "Now it is all
play," said the young man. "Not exactly play,
but.... Next month we shall go to work in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
earnest. We have a lesson to give to a huge
beast. There it is, over there, the monster!"
The monster was the Austrian war steamer <i>Radetzky</i>,
called by the inhabitants of the Piedmontese
shore, <i>el Radescòn</i>. "The ship is just entering the
bay of Laveno," said the young fellow, "coming
from Luino. Come this way if you wish to see
her plainly."</p>

<p>Uncle Piero knew his eyes were not strong
enough to see the steamer, so he sat down on the
first bench he found under the <i>Strobus</i>, which
stood just in front of a group of bamboos, and was
flanked by two groups of large azaleas. Behind
the bamboos, between the great twisted trunks
of the <i>Strobus</i>, he could see the mirror of white
water trembling as far as the black line of the hills
of Ispra. The sky, dark towards the north, was
clear in that quarter. Luisa and the gardener
went to the gate which bears the coat of arms, and
which faces the green Isola Madre, Pallanza, and
the upper lake. Luisa looked out over the immense
expanse of leaden water, crowned by misty
giants from the Sasso di Ferro group above Laveno
to the mountains of Maccagno, and to the distant
snows of the Splügen. The smoke of the <i>Radetzky</i>
was more plainly visible than its body, and the
drums of Pallanza were still rolling. Uncle Piero
called the gardener and Luisa went to lean against
the parapet beside the gate, and near the yew-tree
that rises from the terrace below. The tree
shut out the view on the east. She was glad to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
be alone at last, to rest her eyes and her thoughts
on the grey of the great mountains and of the
great waters. Presently the gardener came back
to point out to her the yellow acacias and the white
heather that were blossoming on the lower terrace.
"The <i>bruyères blanches</i> bring luck," said he.
Seeing that Luisa was lost in thought, and did not
heed him, he started towards the hot-house containing
the begonias. "An old <i>Strobus</i>," said he,
speaking in a loud voice that the visitors might
hear him, but without looking around, "An old
<i>Strobus</i> that has been struck by lightning. If you
wish to visit the private gardens&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Luisa turned from the parapet and went to
fetch the uncle, and give him her arm if necessary.
The gardener, who was waiting at the entrance of
the little grove of laurels, saw her start towards
the old gentleman, who was still sitting on the
bench, saw her quicken her pace and then rush to
his side with a cry.</p>

<p>Like the innocent and aged tree Uncle Piero
also had been struck down. His body was resting
against the back of the bench, his head had fallen
forward, and his chin touched his breast. His
eyes were open, fixed and expressionless. It had
indeed been a farewell spectacle his beloved Valsolda
had offered him the day before. Uncle
Piero, the dear, venerable, old man, wise, upright,
and fatherly, the benefactor of his own people,
Uncle Piero was gone, gone forever. He had come
to enlist, but God had called him to a higher service;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
the bugle had sounded, and he had answered
the call. The drums of Pallanza still rolled, rolled
for the end of the old world, and rolled for the
advent of the new. In Luisa's womb there lay
a vital germ which was preparing to fight the
battles of a new era, preparing to taste other joys,
other griefs than those which the man of the old
world was leaving thus peacefully, blessed unconsciously,
at the last moment, by that strange
priest of Isola Bella, who had, perhaps, never
uttered the holy words to one more worthy.</p>

<h4>"<i>A Remarkable Book</i>"</h4>

<h2>SAN CELESTINO</h2>

<h3>BY JOHN AYSCOUGH</h3>

<h4>Author of "MAROTZ," "DROMINA," etc.</h4>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><b>In form, it is almost exactly like a novel with
frequent conversations, and going, in minor matters
at least, far beyond the record of history. The narrative
opens with Petruccio as a child in the home
of his parents, who belong to the minor nobility
of the Abruzzi. It follows his career at Salerno,
where he attended the University as a lonely figure
making few friends. Afterwards he became a
hermit and the story tells how disciples gathered
round him, beginning with two worldly young men
who had known him at Salerno. The Order of
the Celestines thus founded grew in numbers and
importance through fifty quiet years, when the call
to the Papacy came. From this point, Mr. Ayscough's
chronicle moves swiftly and dramatically&mdash;the
poor simple old man dragged weeping from his
hermit's cave and borne to the triumph from which
he shrank in horror,&mdash;the miserable weeks in
Rome, touching examples of his simplicity and
guilelessness. Then the peace which came with
the renunciation, and his last days passed quite
happily as a captive in a prison cell.</b></p>

<h2>MAROTZ</h2>

<h3>By John Ayscough</h3>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p><b>A story of the present day, containing
vivid word pictures of Southern Italian
and Sicilian life, written by a distinguished
Catholic. The passionate peoples of the
South, tempered by the sweet influences of
religion, despite science and modernity, are
depicted with great fidelity. It is safe to
say that no truer account of Convent life
has ever been printed.</b></p>

<h2>The<br />
Trilogy of Rome</h2>

<h4>By</h4>

<h3><span class="smcap">Antonio Fogazzaro</span></h3>

<h4><i>The Greatest of Italian Novelists</i>"<br />
(Authorized American Editions)</h4>

<h3>1. The Patriot</h3>
<h4>(Piccolo Mondo Antico)</h4>
<h3>2. The Sinner</h3>
<h4>(Piccolo Mondo Moderno)</h4>
<h3>3. The Saint</h3>
<h4>(Il Santo)</h4>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p>The first of these romances is an impassioned
story of lovers struggling to break the barriers
of aristocratic prejudice that oppose their marriage.
It is also a story of patriotism&mdash;of the freeing of
Italy from the Austrian yoke.</p>

<p>In <i>The Sinner</i>, the second book of this Trilogy,
we read the dramatic story of Piero Maironi, the
son of the hero of <i>The Patriot</i>, and of his love for
the beautiful Jeanne Dessalle,&mdash;a story that presents
a vivid picture of the Italian world of rank
and fashion, and involves, too, a study of political
and ecclesiastical life.</p>

<p>In <i>The Saint</i>, the concluding novel in the series,
the hero of <i>The Sinner</i> and the lover of Jeanne
Dessalle appears as a penitent full of religious
zeal that finds a double outlet&mdash;in asceticism
and works of mercy and in an attempt to reform
the Church of Rome from within.</p>
